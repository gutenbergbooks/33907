<h1><span class="pagenum"><a id="pagevii" name="pagevii"></a>(p. vii)</span> PREFACE</h1>


<p>Perhaps the student who is going to read the plays in this
collection may have felt at some time or other a gap between
the "classics" that he was working over in school and the
contemporary literature that he heard commonly discussed, but
he does not know that until recently few books were studied
in the high school that were less than half a century old. Consciousness
of the gap often drove him to trashy reading. He
recognized Addison as respectable but remote, and yet he had
no guide to the good literature which the writers of his own
day were producing and which would be especially interesting
to him, because its ideas and language would be more nearly
contemporary with his own.</p>

<p>Even though the greatest literature has the quality of universality,
it has been almost invariably my experience that, only
as one grows older, is one quite ready to appreciate this quality.
When one is young, it is easier to enjoy literature written from
a point of view nearer to one's own life and times. Reading
good contemporary literature is likely also to pave the way for
a deeper appreciation of the great masterpieces of all time.</p>

<p>This is a collection of one-act plays, some of them less than
five years old, chosen both because their appeal seems not to be
limited to the adult audiences for which they were originally
written, and because they may well serve the purpose of introducing
the student to contemporary dramatists of standing.
Some of them, it is true, make use of old stories and traditions,
but the treatment is in all cases modern, if we except the literary
fashion that we find in Josephine Preston Peabody's
<i>Fortune and Men's Eyes</i>. This, though it is a one-act play,
a modern development, is written more or less in the Shakespearian
convention; but whether we are bookish or not, we
can hardly help having a knowledge of Shakespeare's plays,
because, popular with all kinds of people, they are continually
being revived on the stage, and quoted in conversation.</p>

<p>The plays in this book, though intended for class-room study,
may be acted as well as read. The general introduction will
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pageviii" name="pageviii"></a>(p. viii)</span> be found helpful to groups who produce plays, to those who
live in cities and go to the theatre often, and to those who like
to experiment with dramatic composition. For this book was
planned to encourage an understanding attitude towards the
theatre, to deepen the love that is latent in the majority of
us for what is beautiful and uplifting in the drama, and to
make playgoing a less expensive, more regular, and more intelligent
diversion for the generation that is growing up.</p>

<h1><span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexiii" name="pagexiii"></a>(p. xiii)</span> INTRODUCTION<br>
<span class="smaller">THE WORKMANSHIP OF THE ONE-ACT PLAY</span></h1>


<p>The one-act play is a new form of the drama and more
emphatically a new form of literature. Its possibilities began
to attract the attention of European and American writers in
the last decade of the nineteenth century, those years when so
many dramatic traditions lapsed and so many precedents
were established. It is significant that the oldest play in the
present collection is Maeterlinck's <i>The Intruder</i>, published
in 1890.</p>

<p>The history of this new form is of necessity brief. Before
its vogue became general, one-act plays were being presented
in vaudeville houses in this country and were being used as
curtain raisers in London theatres for the purpose of marking
time until the late-dining audiences should arrive. With the
exception of the famous Grand Guignol Theatre in Paris,
where the entertainment for an evening might consist of several
one-act plays, all of the hair-raising, blood-curdling variety,
programs composed entirely of one-act plays were rare. Sir
James Matthew Barrie is usually credited with being the first
in England to write one-act plays intended to be grouped in
a single production. A program of this character has been uncommon
in the commercial theatre in America, but three of
Barrie's one-act plays, constituting a single program, have met
with enthusiastic response from American audiences.</p>

<p>There are two new developments in the history of the
theatre that have encouraged and promoted the writing of one-act
plays: the one is the Repertory Theatre abroad and the
other is the Little Theatre movement on both sides of the Atlantic.
The repertory of the Irish Players, for example, is
composed largely of one-act plays, and American Little Theatres
are given over almost exclusively to the one-act play.</p>

<p>The one-act play is in reality so new a phenomenon, in spite
of the use that has been made of the form by playwrights like
Pinero, Hauptmann, Chekov, Shaw, and others of the first
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexiv" name="pagexiv"></a>(p. xiv)</span> rank, that it is still generally ignored in books on dramatic
workmanship.<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1" title="Go to footnote 1"><span class="smaller">[1]</span></a> None the less, the status of the one-act play is
established and a study of the plays of this length, which are
rapidly increasing in number, discloses certain tendencies and
laws which are exemplified in the form itself. Clayton Hamilton
sums up the matter well when he says: "The one-act
play is admirable in itself, as a medium of art. It shows the
same relation to the full-length play as the short-story shows
to the novel. It makes a virtue of economy of means. It
aims to produce a single dramatic effect with the greatest
economy of means that is consistent with the utmost emphasis.
The method of the one-act play at its best is similar to the
method employed by Browning in his dramatic monologues.
The author must suggest the entire history of a soul by seizing
it at some crisis of its career and forcing the spectator to look
upon it from an unexpected and suggestive point of view. A
one-act play in exhibiting the present should imply the past
and intimate the future. The author has no leisure for laborious
exposition; but his mere projection of a single situation
should sum up in itself the accumulated results of many antecedent
causes.... The form is complete, concise and self-sustaining;
it requires an extraordinary force of imagination."<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2" title="Go to footnote 2"><span class="smaller">[2]</span></a></p>

<p>To follow for a moment a train of thought suggested by
Mr. Hamilton's timely and appreciative comment on the technique
of the one-act play: All writers on the short-story agree
that, to use Poe's phrase, "the vastly important artistic element,
totality, or unity of effect" is indispensable to the successful
short-story. This singleness of effect is an equally important
consideration in the structure of the one-act play. A
short-story is not a condensed novel any more than a one-act
play is a condensed full-length play. There is no fixed length
for the one-act play any more than there is for the short-story.
The one-act play must have its "dominant incident" and
"dominant character" like the short-story. The effect of the
one-act play, as of the short-story, is measured by the way it
makes its readers and spectators feel. Neither the short-story
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexv" name="pagexv"></a>(p. xv)</span> nor the one-act play need necessarily "be founded on one of
the passionate <i>cruces</i> of life, where duty and inclination come
nobly to the grapple." One has but to consider the short-stories
of Henry James or the one-act plays of Galsworthy or
of Maeterlinck to be convinced that a <i>violent</i> struggle is not
necessary to the art of either form.</p>

<p>This point is further illustrated in what Galsworthy himself
says in general about drama in his famous essay, <i>Some
Platitudes Concerning the Drama</i>, which should be read in
connection with his satirical comedy, <i>The Little Man</i>. In
that essay Galsworthy writes: "The plot! A good plot is
that sure edifice which slowly rises out of the interplay of circumstance
on temperament, and temperament on circumstance,
within the enclosing atmosphere of an idea. A human being
is the best plot there is.... Now true dramatic action is what
characters do, at once contrary, as it were, to expectation, and
yet because they have already done other things.... Good
dialogue again is character, marshaled so as continually to
stimulate interest or excitement." This commentary of Galsworthy's
on dramatic technique offers to the student of <i>The
Little Man</i> an unusual opportunity to verify a great critic's
theory by a great playwright's practice. It is indeed the <i>character</i>
of the Little Man that is the plot in this case; the plot
may be said to begin when, according to stage direction, the
hapless Baby wails, and to be well launched with the Little
Man's deprecatory, "Herr Ober! Might I have a glass of
beer?" These words distinguish him immediately from his
bullying companions in the buffet. The highest point of interest,
like the beginning of the plot, is to be found in the play
of the Little Man's personality, at the point where he is left
alone with the Baby, now a typhus suspect, and after an instant's
wavering, bends all his puny energies to pacifying its
uneasy cry. Again, the end of the plot comes with the tribute
of the bewildered but adoring mother to the ineffably gentle
Little Man.</p>

<p>But a one-act play that has any pretensions to literature
must be looked upon as a law unto itself and should not be
expected to conform to any set of arbitrary requirements. As
a matter of fact, there are only a very few generalizations that
can be made with regard to the structure or to the classification
of the one-act play. Even this book contains plays that are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexvi" name="pagexvi"></a>(p. xvi)</span> not susceptible of any hard and fast classification. <i>The Intruder</i>
and <i>Riders to the Sea</i> are indubitably tragedies, but
<i>Fortune and Men's Eyes</i>, dealing, as it does, with the tragic
theme of love's disillusionment, belongs not at all with the plays
of Maeterlinck and Synge, shadowed, as they are, by death.
And though the deaths are many and bloody in <i>A Night at
an Inn</i>, the unreality of the romance is so strong that there is
no such wrenching of the human sympathies as we associate
with tragedy. <i>The Pierrot of the Minute</i> is superficially a
Harlequinade, but Dowson's insistence on the theme of satiety
brings it narrowly within the range of satire. <i>Beauty and the
Jacobin</i> is rich in comedy; so is Lady Gregory's <i>Spreading the
News</i>, and in both, the situations change imperceptibly from
comedy to farce and from farce back to comedy.</p>

<p>The laws of the structure of the one-act play are in the
nature of dramatic art no less flexible. It can be said that in
order to secure that singleness of impression that is as essential
to the one-act play as to the short-story, a single well sustained
theme is necessary, a theme announced in some fashion early
in the play. Indeed since the one-act play is a short dramatic
form, it may be said in regard to the announcing of the
theme that, "'Twere well it were done quickly." In <i>Spreading
the News</i>, the curtain is barely up before Mrs. Tarpey is
telling the magistrate: "Business, is it? What business would
the people here have but to be minding one another's business?"
And at approximately the same moment in the action
of <i>The Intruder</i>, the uncle, foreshadowing the theme of the
mysterious coming of death, says: "When once illness has
come into a house, it is as though a stranger had forced himself
into the family circle."</p>

<p>The single dominant theme for its dramatic expression calls
also for a single situation developing to a single climax. In
the case of <i>Fortune and Men's Eyes</i>, it is the ballad-monger,
who in crying his wares,</p>

<p class="poem10">
<span class="add2em">"Plays, Play not Fair,</span><br>
Or how a <i>gentlewoman's</i> heart was took<br>
By a player, that was King in a stage-play,"</p>

<p>gives us in the first few minutes of the play his ironical clue
to the theme. And this theme is worked out in Mary Fytton's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexvii" name="pagexvii"></a>(p. xvii)</span> shallow intrigue with William Herbert, which culminates in
the shattering of the Player's dream on that autumn day in
South London at "The Bear and the Angel."</p>

<p>The single situation exemplifying the theme of <i>The Intruder</i>
is found in the repeatedly expressed premonitions of the blind
Grandfather, stationary in his armchair, whose heightened
senses detect the presence of the Mysterious Stranger. The
unity of effect secured in this play is only rivaled, not surpassed,
by the wonderful totality of impression experienced by
the reader of <i>The Fall of the House of Usher</i>. The unity of
effect in <i>The Intruder</i> is secured also by Maeterlinck's description
of the setting, which reminds the playgoer or the reader
inevitably of Stevenson's familiar words: "Certain dark gardens
cry aloud for murder; certain old houses demand to be
haunted."</p>

<p>In general, as has been said, the plot of the one-act play,
because of the time limitations, admits of no distracting incidents.
For the same reason the characterization must be swift
and direct. By Bartley Fallon's first speech in <i>Spreading the
News</i>, Lady Gregory characterizes him completely. He needs
but say: "Indeed it's a poor country and a scarce country to
be living in. But I'm thinking if I went to America it's long
ago the day I'd be dead," and the fundamental part of his
character is fixed in the minds of the audience. From that
moment it is just a question of filling in the picture with
pantomime and further dialogue.</p>

<p>The characterization of the Player in <i>Fortune and Men's
Eyes</i> begins at the moment that he enters the tavern, when
Wat, the bear-ward, calls out:</p>

<p class="poem10">
"I say, I've played.... There's not one man<br>
Of all the gang&mdash;save one.... Ay, there be one<br>
I grant you, now!... He used me in right sort;<br>
A man worth better trades."</p>

<p>Wat's verdict on the fair-mindedness of Master William
Shakespeare of the Lord Chamberlain's company is borne out
by the Player's own,</p>

<p class="poem20">
<span class="add2em">"High fortune, man!</span><br>
Commend me to thy bear."<br>
<span class="left30">[<i>Drinks and passes him the cup.</i>]</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexviii" name="pagexviii"></a>(p. xviii)</span> The entrance of the ballad-monger gives Master Will an opening
for a punning jest and, the action continuing, shows him
sympathetic to the strayed lady-in-waiting, tender to the tavern
boy, magnanimous to the false friend and falser love.</p>

<p>One method of characterization which the author allows herself
to use in this play, no doubt to heighten the Elizabethan
illusion, is rare in the contemporary drama: when this "dark
lady of the sonnets" flees "The Bear and the Angel," the
Player breaks forth into the self-revealing soliloquy, found
so frequently in his own plays, and continuing as a dramatic
convention until the last quarter of the nineteenth
century.<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3" title="Go to footnote 3"><span class="smaller">[3]</span></a></p>

<p>Characterization rests in part on pantomime. In <i>The Little
Man</i>, the Dutch Youth is dumb throughout the play, but he
is sufficiently characterized by his foolish demeanor and his recurrent
laugh. The part of the Little Man himself is one
long gesture of humility and dedication. In those one-act
plays in which the old characters of the Harlequinade reappear,
like <i>The Maker of Dreams</i> and <i>The Pierrot of the Minute</i>,
pantomime transcends dialogue as a method of characterization.
In the plays of the Irish dramatists, Synge, Yeats, and
Lady Gregory, pantomime and dialogue contribute equally to
the characterization, which is of a very high order, since all
these dramatists were close observers of the Irish peasant characters
of their plays.</p>

<p>Synge, especially, illustrates the following critical theory of
Galsworthy: "The art of writing true dramatic dialogue is
an austere art, denying itself all license, grudging every sentence
devoted to the mere machinery of the play, suppressing
all jokes and epigrams severed from character, relying for fun
and pathos on the fun and tears of life. From start to finish
good dialogue is hand-made, like good lace; clear, of fine texture,
furthering with each thread the harmony and strength
of a design to which all must be subordinated." A study of
the dialogue of <i>Riders to the Sea</i> reveals just this harmony
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexix" name="pagexix"></a>(p. xix)</span> between the dialogue and the inevitability of the plot, the dialogue
and the simplicity of the characters.</p>

<p>The dialogue in <i>The Little Man</i> is the very idiom one
would expect to issue from the mouth of the German colonel,
the Englishman with the Oxford voice, or the intensely national
American, as the case may be. The characters, though
they have type names, are, as Mr. Galsworthy would probably
be the first to explain, highly individualized. The author does
not intend us to think that all Americans are like this loud-voiced
traveler, or all Englishmen like the pharisaical gentleman
who gives his wife the advertisements to read while he
secures the news sheet for himself.</p>

<p>The function of dialogue is the same both in the long and
in the short play. For, of course, both forms have many things
in common. For instance, as in the full-length play it is
necessary for the dramatist to carry forward the interest from
act to act, to provide a "curtain" that will leave the audience
in a state of suspense, so in the one-act play, the interest must
be similarly relayed though the plot is confined to a single act.
In <i>The Intruder</i>, every premonition expressed by the Grandfather
grips the audience in such a way that they await from
minute to minute the coming of the mysterious stranger. The
tension is high in <i>A Night at an Inn</i> from the moment the
curtain rises. In <i>Riders to the Sea</i>, the beginning of the suspense
coincides with the opening of the play and lasts.
"They're all gone now, and there isn't anything more the sea
can do to me," says Maurya, and the audience experiences a
rush of relief and a sense of release that the last words, "No
man at all can be living for ever, and we must be satisfied,"
seem only to deepen.</p>

<p>A one-act play, then, has many structural features in common
with the short-story; its plot must from beginning to end
be dominated by a single theme; its crises may be crises of
character as well as conflicts of will or physical conflicts; it
must by a method of foreshadowing sustain the interest of the
audience unflaggingly, but ultimately relieve their tension; it
must achieve swift characterization by means of pantomime and
dialogue; and its dialogue must achieve its effects by the same
methods as the dialogue of longer plays, but by even greater
economy of means. But when all is said and done, the success
of a one-act play is judged not by its conformity to any set
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexx" name="pagexx"></a>(p. xx)</span> of hard and fast rules, but by its power to interest, enlighten,
and hold an audience.</p>


<h2>THEATRES OF TO-DAY<br>
<span class="smaller">THE COMMERCIAL THEATRE AND THE REPERTORY IDEA</span></h2>

<p>The term "Commercial Theatre" is rarely used without
disparagement. The critic or the playwright who speaks of
the Commercial Theatre usually does so either for the purpose
of reflecting on the cheapness of the entertainment afforded,
or in order to call attention to spectacular receipts.</p>

<p>In this country the Commercial Theatre stands for that form
of big business in the theatrical world that produces dividends
on the money invested comparable to those earned by the most
prosperous of the large industries. This system has been, on
the whole, a bad thing for the drama, because managers with
their eye on attractions that should yield a return, let us say,
of over ten per cent on the investment, have been unable to
produce the superior play with an appeal to a definite, though
perhaps limited audience, and have had to offer to the public
the kind of play that would draw large audiences over a long
period of time. The "longest run for the safest possible play"
is thus conspicuously associated with the Commercial Theatre.
As Clayton Hamilton says: "The trouble with the prevailing
theatre system in America to-day is not that this system is commercial;
for in any democratic country, it is not unreasonable
to expect the public to defray the cost of the sort of drama
that it wishes, and that, therefore, it deserves. The trouble is,
rather, that our theatre system is devoted almost entirely to
big business; and that in ignoring the small profits of small
business it tends to exclude not only the uncommercial drama,
but the non-commercial drama as well."<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4" title="Go to footnote 4"><span class="smaller">[4]</span></a> Here he makes
a distinction between an "uncommercial" play, that is, a play
that is a failure with all kinds of audiences, and the "noncommercial"
play, which is capable of holding its own financially
and yielding modest returns.</p>

<p>In the days before the pooling of theatrical interests in this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxi" name="pagexxi"></a>(p. xxi)</span> country there were indeed long runs, but in many of the large
American cities "stock companies," composed of groups of
actors and actresses all of about the same reputation and
ability, were maintained that kept a number of plays, a "repertory,"
before the public in the course of a season and gave
scope for experiment with various kinds of plays. But the
"star system," which has now become common, has tended to
drive out the "stock company" idea, with the result that the
average company rests on the reputation of the "star" and
dispenses with distinction in the "support." With the decay
of the stock company, the repertory system, in the form in
which it did once exist here in the Commercial Theatre, has
also declined.</p>

<p>Both in Great Britain and in America the repertory system,
long established on the Continent, has been reintroduced in
order to combat the practices of the Commercial Theatre. For
the most part the new repertory theatres have been endowed
either by the State or by private individuals. "Absolute endowment
for absolute freedom,"<a id="footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5" title="Go to footnote 5"><span class="smaller">[5]</span></a> has seemed to at least one
American the only means of delivering the drama from commercial
bondage. This phrase of Percy MacKaye's expresses
his cherished belief that endowed civic theatres, which should
encourage the participation of whole communities in a community
form of drama, are what is needed in a democracy.
John Masefield, in the following lines from the prologue
written for the opening of the Liverpool Repertory Theatre,
has found a poetic theme in this idea of an endowed theatre:</p>

<div class="poem10">
<p>"Men will not spend, it seems, on that one art<br>
Which is life's inmost soul and passionate heart;<br>
They count the theatre a place for fun,<br>
Where man can laugh at nights when work is done.</p>

<p>If it were only that, 'twould be worth while<br>
To subsidize a thing which makes men smile;<br>
But it is more; it is that splendid thing,<br>
A place where man's soul shakes triumphant wing;</p>

<p>A place of art made living, where men may see<br>
What human life is and has seemed to be<br>
To the world's greatest brains....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxii" name="pagexxii"></a>(p. xxii)</span>
<span class="add6em">O you who hark</span><br>
Fan to a flame through England this first spark,<br>
Till in this land there's none so poor of purse<br>
But he may see high deeds and hear high verse,<br>
And feel his folly lashed, and think him great<br>
In this world's tragedy of Life and Fate."<a id="footnotetag6" name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6" title="Go to footnote 6"><span class="smaller">[6]</span></a></p>
</div>

<p>In Great Britain repertory is associated with the interest
and generosity of Miss A. E. F. Horniman, who will be mentioned
in connection with the Irish National Theatre, and
through whom, after some preliminary experiment, the Gaiety
Theatre at Manchester was opened as the first repertory house
in England, in the spring of 1908. Fifty-five different plays
were produced in a little over two years&mdash;"twenty-eight new,
seventeen revivals of modern English plays, five modern translations,
and five classics."<a id="footnotetag7" name="footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7" title="Go to footnote 7"><span class="smaller">[7]</span></a> In Miss Horniman's own words,
her interest was in a Civilized Theatre. "A Civilized
Theatre," she has written, "means that a city has something
of cultivation in it, something to make literature grow; a real
theatre, not a mere amusing toy. What we want is the opportunity
for our men and women, our boys and girls to get a
chance to see the works of the greatest dramatists of modern
times, as well as the classics, for their pleasure as well as their
cultivation.... Young dramatists should have a theatre
where they can see the ripe works of the masters and see them
well acted at a moderate price. There should be in every city
a theatre where we can see the best drama worthily treated."<a id="footnotetag8" name="footnotetag8"></a><a href="#footnote8" title="Go to footnote 8"><span class="smaller">[8]</span></a>
Owing to war conditions, the Manchester project has had to
be abandoned, and so, for the most part, have other similar
enterprises. They rarely became self-supporting, but depended
on subsidy of one kind or another, which under new economic
conditions is no longer forthcoming. The Birmingham Repertory
Theatre continues, however, under the direction of John
Drinkwater, and has become famous through its production of
his <i>Abraham Lincoln</i>. "John Drinkwater, I see, has recently
defined a Repertory Theatre," writes William Archer, in his
latest article on the subject, "as one which 'puts plays into
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxiii" name="pagexxiii"></a>(p. xxiii)</span> stock which are good enough to stay there.'" Enlarging this
definition, I should call it a theatre which excluded the long
unbroken run; which presents at least three different programs
in each week (though a popular success may be performed
three or even four times a week throughout a whole
season); which can produce plays too good to be enormously
popular; which makes a principle of keeping alive the great
drama of the past, whether recent or remote; which has a
company so large that it can, without overworking its actors,
keep three or four plays ready for instant presentation; which
possesses an ample stage equipped with the latest artistic and
labor-saving appliances; and which offers such comfort in front
of the house as to encourage an intelligent public to make it an
habitual place of resort.</p>

<p>"That there exists in every great American city an intelligent
public large enough to support one or more such playhouses is
to my mind indisputable. But the theatre might have to be
run at a loss for two or three opening seasons, until it had
attracted and educated its habitual supporters. For even a
public of high general intelligence needs a certain amount of
special education in things of the theatre." This testimony is
in a highly optimistic vein.</p>

<p>A talk with B. Iden Payne, once director of the Manchester
Players, reveals the fact that in England at the present time
the repertory idea is being taken over with more promise of
success by the small groups that represent the Little Theatre
movement in that country. The repertory theatre there did
succeed in arousing in the locality in which, for the time being,
it existed an interest in intelligent plays, but it was not equally
successful in confirming a distaste for unintelligent plays. The
study of these experiments will repay Americans who are interested
in seeing the repertory idea fostered over here by endowment
or otherwise.</p>


<h2>THE LITTLE THEATRE</h2>

<p>The year 1911 saw the beginning in the United States of
the Little Theatre movement, which has grown with phenomenal
rapidity and has spread in all directions. The first
Little Theatres in this country were located in large cities; but
in the course of time the idea has penetrated to small towns
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxiv" name="pagexxiv"></a>(p. xxiv)</span> and rural communities all over the United States. Barns,
wharves, saloons, and school assembly halls have been transformed
into intimate little playhouses. There were European
precedents for this idea. The Théâtre Libre, opened in Paris
in 1887 by André Antoine as a protest against the kind of
play then in favor, is generally called the first of this type.
In the years from 1887 to 1911 Little Theatres were opened
in Russia, in Belgium, in Germany, in Sweden, in Hungary,
in England, in Ireland, and in France. In Europe these
theatres came into being, generally speaking, in order to give
freer play to the new arts of the theatre or for the purpose
of encouraging a more intellectual type of drama than was being
produced in the larger houses.</p>

<p>There are two conceptions of the Little Theatre current in
the United States. According to one, it is a theatrical organization
housed in a simple building, that makes its productions
in the most economical way, does not pay its actors, does not
charge admission, and uses scenery and properties that are
cheaply manufactured at home.</p>

<a id="img001" name="img001"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img001.jpg" width="600" height="395" alt="" title="">
<p><i>Twelfth Night</i> on the stage of the Théâtre du Vieux Colombier, New York.</p>
</div>

<p>The Little Theatre is, however, more commonly conceived
of as a repertory theatre supported by the subscription system,
producing its plays on a small stage in a small hall, selecting
for production the kind of play not likely to be used by the
Commercial Theatre, most frequently the one-act play, and committed
to experiments in stage decoration, lighting, and the
other stage arts. The Little Theatre and the one-act play
have developed each other reciprocally, for the Little Theatre
has encouraged the writing of one-act plays in Europe and in
this country. The one-act play is the natural unit of production
in the Little Theatre, both because it requires a less
sustained performance from the actors, who have frequently
been amateurs, and because it has offered in the same evening
several opportunities to the various groups of artists collaborating
in the productions of the Little Theatre. Though the
movement has had the effect of stimulating community spirit
and has been the means of solving grave community problems,
the Little Theatre is not, in the technical sense, a community
theatre; in the sense, that is, in which Percy MacKaye uses the
word. It is not, in fact, so portentous an enterprise, because it
does not enlist the participation of every member of a community.
The community theatre is an example of civic co-operation
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxv" name="pagexxv"></a>(p. xxv)</span> on a large scale; the Little Theatre, of the same kind
of co-operation on a small scale.</p>

<p>Notably artistic results have been achieved by such Little
Theatres as The Neighborhood Playhouse in New York, built
in 1914 by the Misses Irene and Alice Lewisohn, in connection
with the social settlement idea, to provide expression for the
talents of a community that had been previously trained in
dramatic classes for some years; by the Chicago Little Theatre,
founded in 1911, now no longer in existence, but for a few
years under the direction of Maurice Browne, a disciple of
Gordon Craig's; by the Detroit Theatre of Arts and Crafts,
once under the direction of Mr. Sam Hume, also a follower
of Gordon Craig's; by the Washington Square Players, who
during several seasons in New York gave a remarkable impetus
to the writing of one-act plays in America; by the Provincetown
Players, whose first productions were made on Cape Cod,
who later opened a small playhouse in New York, and who
gave the public an opportunity to know the plays of Eugene
O'Neill; by the Portmanteau Theatre of Stuart Walker, that
uses but one setting in its productions, but varies the effect
with different colored lights, and as its name implies, is portable,
one of the few of its kind in the world; by the 47 Workshop
Theatre that has arisen as the result of the course in playwriting
given at Harvard University by Professor George Pierce
Baker, and the productions of which have served to introduce
many new writers; and by the Théâtre du Vieux Colombier,
that came to New York from Paris in 1917, and remained for
two seasons to illustrate the best French practice. These
theatres also enjoy the distinction of having experimented with
repertory.</p>

<p>The Théâtre du Vieux Colombier was organized and is directed
by Jacques Copeau. It is no casual amateur experiment.
Its actors are professionals and its director is a scholar
and an artist. In preparation for the original opening the company
went into the country and established a little colony.
"During five hours of each day they studied repertoire but
they did far more. They performed exercises in physical culture
and the dance: they read aloud and acted improvised
dramatic scenes. They worked thus upon their bodies, their
voices and their actions: made them subtle instruments in their
command." They learned that in an artistic production every
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxvi" name="pagexxvi"></a>(p. xxvi)</span> gesture, every word, every line, and every color counted.
Naturally no group of amateurs or semi-professionals can approach
the results of a company trained as M. Copeau's is.
When he was over here, he was much interested in our Little
Theatres. He said in one of his addresses: "All the <i>little
theatres</i> which now swarm in America, ought to come to an
understanding among themselves and unite, instead of trying
to keep themselves apart and distinctive. The ideas which they
possess in common have not even begun to be put into execution.
They must be incorporated into life."<a id="footnotetag9" name="footnotetag9"></a><a href="#footnote9" title="Go to footnote 9"><span class="smaller">[9]</span></a></p>

<p>The native Little Theatres, much simpler affairs than the
Vieux Colombier, persist. They have made a place for themselves
in American life, among the farms, in the suburbs, in the
small towns, and in the cities. Sometimes, no doubt, they are
like the one in Sinclair Lewis's Gopher Prairie; or they hardly
outlast a season. But new ones spring up to replace those that
have gone out of existence, and meanwhile the ends of wholesome
community recreation are being served.</p>


<h2>THE IRISH NATIONAL THEATRE</h2>

<p>About 1890 began the movement which has since been
known as the Celtic Renaissance, a movement that had for its
object the lifting into literature of the songs, myths, romances,
and legends treasured for countless generations in the hearts
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxvii" name="pagexxvii"></a>(p. xxvii)</span> of the Irish peasantry. In the same decade in Great Britain
and on the Continent, tendencies were at work looking to the
reform of the drama and its rescue from commercial formulas.
The genesis of the Irish National Theatre, a pioneer in the
field of repertory in Great Britain, and one of the first of the
Little Theatres, is due to both of these influences.</p>

<p>Its first form was the Irish Literary Theatre, founded in
1899 by Edward Martyn, the author of <i>The Heather Field</i>
and <i>Maeve</i>, George Moore, and William Butler Yeats. The
first play produced by this organization was Yeats's <i>Countess
Cathleen</i>. This enterprise employed only English actors, and
did not assume to be purely national in scope. It came to an
end in October, 1901. It was in October, 1902, that in
<i>Samhain</i>, the organ of the Irish National Theatre, William
Butler Yeats made the following announcement: "The Irish
Literary Theatre has given place to a company of Irish actors."
The nucleus of this new Irish National Theatre was certain
companies of amateurs that W. G. Fay had assembled.
These companies were composed of people who were unable to
give full time to their interest in the drama, but who came
from the office or the shop to rehearse at odd moments during
the day and in the evening. The Irish National Theatre really
developed from these amateur companies. It was strictly national
in scope. The advisers, who were to include Synge,
Lady Gregory, Padraic Colum, William Butler Yeats, and
others, looked to the Irish National Theatre to bring the drama
back to the people, to whom plays dealing with society life
meant nothing. They intended also that their plays "should
give them [the people] a quite natural pleasure, should either
tell them of their own life, or of that life of poetry where
every man can see his own magic, because there alone does
human nature escape from arbitrary conditions." This program
has been carried out with remarkable success.</p>

<p>October, 1902, is the date for the beginning of the Irish
National Theatre. At first W. G. Fay, and his brother,
Frank Fay, were in charge of the productions, the former as
stage manager. Frank Fay had charge of training a company,
in which the star system was unknown. He had studied
French methods of stage diction and gesture, and the Irish
Players are generally said to show the results of his familiarity
with great French models. In 1913 a school of acting was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxviii" name="pagexxviii"></a>(p. xxviii)</span> organized in order to perpetuate the tradition created by the
Fays.</p>

<p>Among the most famous playwrights who have written for
the Irish National Theatre are Padraic Colum, John Millington
Synge, William Butler Yeats, Lady Gregory, St. John
G. Ervine, Æ (George W. Russell), and Lord Dunsany.
At one time the theatre sent out, in a circular addressed to
aspiring authors who showed promise, the following counsel:
"A play to be suitable for performance at the Abbey should
contain some criticism of life, founded on the experience or
personal observation of the writer, or some vision of life, of
Irish life by preference, important from its beauty or from
some excellence of style, and this intellectual quality is not
more necessary to tragedy than to the gayest comedy."<a id="footnotetag10" name="footnotetag10"></a><a href="#footnote10" title="Go to footnote 10"><span class="smaller">[10]</span></a></p>

<p>In 1904 the Irish National Theatre was housed for the first
time in its own playhouse, the Abbey Theatre. This change
was made possible by the generosity of Miss A. E. F. Horniman,
who saw the Irish Players when they first went to London
in 1903. It was she who obtained the lease of the Mechanics'
Institute in Dublin, increased its capacity, and rebuilt it, giving
it rent free to the Players from 1904 to 1909, in addition to
an annual subsidy which she allowed them. In 1910 the
Abbey Theatre was bought from her by public subscription.
The next year, the Irish Players paid their famous visit to the
United States.</p>

<p>The Irish National Dramatic Company was organized as a
protest against current theatrical practices. Its founders purposed
to reform the various arts of the theatre. By encouraging
native playwrights they hoped to do for the drama of
Ireland what Ibsen and other writers had done for the drama
in Scandinavian countries, where people go to the theatre to
think as well as to feel. It was not intended in any sense
that these new Irish players were to serve the purpose of
propaganda; truth was not to be compromised in the service
of a cause. Acting, too, was to be improved: redundant gesture
was to be suppressed; repose was to be given its full value;
speech was to be made more important than gesture. Yeats
in particular had theories as to the way in which verse should
be spoken on the stage; he advocated a cadenced chant,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxix" name="pagexxix"></a>(p. xxix)</span> monotonous but not sing-song, for the delivery of poetry. The
simplification of costume and setting was also included in their
scheme, for both were to be strictly accessory to the speech and
movement of the characters.</p>

<p>They have been faithful to their ideals. The performances
at the Abbey Theatre continue, although from time to time
certain of the most eminent actors of the company have withdrawn,
some to migrate to America. Among the plays produced
in 1919 and 1920 by the National Theatre Society at
the Abbey Theatre are W. B. Yeats's <i>The Land of Heart's
Desire</i>, G. B. Shaw's <i>Androcles and the Lion</i>, Lady Gregory's
<i>The Dragon</i>, and Lord Dunsany's <i>The Glittering Gate</i>.</p>


<h2>THE NEW ART OF THE THEATRE</h2>

<p>There are certain facts about the artistic transformation that
the theatre is undergoing in the twentieth century with which
students of the drama need to be familiar in order to picture
for themselves how plays can be interpreted by means of design,
color, and light. The transformation is definitely connected
with a few famous names. In Europe two men, Edward
Gordon Craig and Max Reinhardt, stand out as reformers in
matters connected with the construction, the lighting, and the
design of stage settings. In this country the artists of the
theatre are, generally speaking, disciples of one or both of these
great Europeans and their colleagues. The new stage artist
studies the characterization and the situations in the play, the
production of which he is directing, and tries to make his setting
suggestive of the physical and emotional atmosphere in
which the action of the drama moves.</p>

<p>Gordon Craig has written several books and many articles
embodying his ideas on play production. In all his writings
he emphasizes the importance of having one individual with
complete authority and complete knowledge in charge of coordinating
and subordinating the various arts that go to make
the production of a play a symmetrical whole, his theory being
that there is no one art that can be called to the exclusion of
all others <i>the</i> Art of the Theatre: not the acting, not the play,
not the setting, not the dance; but that all these properly harmonized
through the personality of the director become the Art
of the Theatre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxx" name="pagexxx"></a>(p. xxx)</span> The kind of setting that has become identified in the popular
mind with Gordon Craig is the simple monochrome background
composed either of draperies or of screens. It is unfortunate
that this popular idea should be so limited because,
of course, the name of Gordon Craig should carry with it the
suggestion of an infinite variety of ways of interpreting the
play through design. His screens, built to stand alone, vary
in number from one to four and sometimes have as many as
ten leaves. They are either made of solid wood or are wooden
frames covered with canvas. The screens with narrow leaves
may be used to produce curved forms, and screens with broad
leaves to enclose large rectangular spaces. The screens are one
form of the setting composed of adjustable units, which can
be adapted in an infinite variety of ways to the needs of the
play.</p>

<p>The new ideas in European stagecraft began to be popularized
in America in the year 1914-15, when under the auspices
of the Stage Society, Sam Hume, now teaching the arts
of the theatre at the University of California, and Kenneth
Macgowan, the dramatic critic, arranged an exhibition that
was shown in New York, Chicago, and other great centres,
of new stage sets designed by Robert Edmond Jones, Sam
Hume, and others who have since become famous. The models
displayed on this occasion brought before the public for the
first time the new method of lighting which, as much as anything
else, differentiates the new theatre art from the old. It
introduced the device of a concave back wall made of plaster,
sometimes called by its German name "horizont," and a lighting
equipment that would dye this plaster horizon with colors
that melted into one another like the colors in the sky; a stage
with "dimmers" for every circuit of lights, and sockets for
high-power lamps at any spot from the stage.</p>

<p>In the same year that the Stage Society showed Robert
Edmond Jones's models, he was given an opportunity to design
the settings and costumes for Granville Barker's production of
Anatole France's <i>The Man Who Married a Dumb Wife</i>,
which may be said to have advertised the new practices in
America more than any other single production.</p>

Edmond Jones. A great round window framed in the heavy
molding of Mantegna and the pale clear sky of Northern Italy.</p>
</div>

<p>Writing of his own work shortly after, Mr. Jones says:
"While the scenery of a play is truly important, it should be
so important that the audience should forget that it is present.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxxi" name="pagexxxi"></a>(p. xxxi)</span> There should be fusion between the play and the scenery.
Scenery isn't there to be looked at, it's really there to be
forgotten. The drama is a fire, the scenery is the air that lifts
the fire and makes it bright.... The audience that is
always conscious of the back drop is paying a doubtful compliment
to the painter.... Even costumes should be the
handiwork of the scenic artist. Yes, and if possible, he should
build the very furniture."<a id="footnotetag11" name="footnotetag11"></a><a href="#footnote11" title="Go to footnote 11"><span class="smaller">[11]</span></a> Robert Edmond Jones has not
only designed settings and costumes for poetic and fantastic
forms of drama, but he has also been called upon to plan the
productions of realistic modern plays.</p>

<p>Three of his designs introducing three different aspects of his
work have been here reproduced. The model for Maeterlinck's
<i>The Seven Princesses</i> is an example of an attempt to present
the essential significant structure of a setting in the simplest
way conceivable and by so doing to stimulate the imagination
of the spectator to create for itself the imaginative environment
of the play. His design for a room in Belmont for <i>The
Merchant of Venice</i> shows a great round window framed in
the heavy molding of Mantegna and the pale, clear sky of
Northern Italy. The scene for <i>Good Gracious Annabelle</i> is a
corridor in an hotel. This scene is a typical example of a
more or less abstract rendering of a literal scene. It was designed
primarily with the idea of giving as many different exits
and entrances as possible, in order that the action of the drama
might be swift and varied.<a id="footnotetag12" name="footnotetag12"></a><a href="#footnote12" title="Go to footnote 12"><span class="smaller">[12]</span></a></p>

<p>When Sam Hume was connected with the Detroit Theatre
of Arts and Crafts, he used a symbolic and suggestive method
for the setting of poetic plays the scene of which was laid in
no definite locality. In this theatre he installed a permanent
setting, including the following units: "Four pylons [square
pillars], constructed of canvas on wooden frames, each of the
three covered faces measuring two and one-half by eighteen
feet; two canvas flats each three by eighteen feet; two sections
of stairs three feet long, and one section eight feet long, of
uniform eighteen-inch height; three platforms of the same
height, respectively six, eight, and twelve feet long; dark green
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxxii" name="pagexxxii"></a>(p. xxxii)</span> hangings as long as the pylons; two folding screens for masking,
covered with the same cloth as that used in the hangings,
and as high as the pylons; and two irregular tree forms in
silhouette.</p>

<p>"The pylons, flats, and stairs, and such added pieces as the
arch and window, were painted in broken color ...<a id="footnotetag13" name="footnotetag13"></a><a href="#footnote13" title="Go to footnote 13"><span class="smaller">[13]</span></a> so
that the surfaces would take on any desired color under the
proper lighting."<a id="footnotetag14" name="footnotetag14"></a><a href="#footnote14" title="Go to footnote 14"><span class="smaller">[14]</span></a> The economy of this method is illustrated
by the fact that in one season nineteen plays were given in the
Arts and Crafts Theatre at Detroit, and the settings for eleven
of these were merely rearrangements of the permanent setting.
This kind of setting is sometimes called "plastic"&mdash;a term
which refers to the fact that the separate units are in the
round, and not flat. The effect secured in settings representing
outdoor scenes was made possible only by the use of a
plaster horizon of the general type described in connection with
the exhibition of the Stage Society.</p>

different exits and entrances as possible in order that the action of the drama might be swift and varied.</p>
</div>

<p>Robert Edmond Jones and Sam Hume are two of an increasingly
large number of artists in America, among whom
should be mentioned Norman-bel Geddes, Maurice Browne,
and Lee Simonson, who are experimenting with design, color,
and light. Underlying the work of all of these is the belief
that the whole production, the play, the acting, the lighting,
and the setting, should be unified by some one dominating
mood. In the work of these new artists, there is no place
for the old-fashioned painted back drop, the use of which
emphasizes the disparity between the painted and the actual
perspective, though their backgrounds are by no means necessarily
either screens or draperies. Another new style of background
is the skeleton setting, a permanent structural foundation
erected on the stage, which through the addition of
draperies and movable properties, or the variation of lights,
or the manipulation of screens, may serve for all the scenes
of a play. A permanent structure of this sort, representing
the Tower of London, was used by Robert Edmond Jones in
a recent production of <i>Richard III</i> in New York, at the
Plymouth Theatre. When Jacques Copeau conducted the
Théâtre du Vieux Colombier in New York he had a permanent
structure built on the stage of the Garrick Theatre,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxxiii" name="pagexxxiii"></a>(p. xxxiii)</span> that he used for all the plays he produced; at times the upper
half of the stage was masked, at times the recess back of the
two central columns was used. The aspect of the stage was
often completely changed by the addition of tapestries, stairs,
panels, screens, and furniture.</p>

<p>In the description of the equipment of the Detroit Theatre
of Arts and Crafts, reference has been made to a method of
painting the plastic units in broken color. This is so important
a principle that it should be more generally understood
by those who are interested in the theatre. The principle was
put into operation by the Viennese designer, Joseph Urban.
In practice it means that a canvas painted with red and with
green spots upon which a red light is played, throws up only the
red spots blended so as to produce a red surface, and that
the same canvas under a green light shows a green surface;
and, if both kinds of lights are used, then both the green and
red spots are brought out, according to the proportion of the
mixture of green and red in the light.</p>

<p>Color is being used now not only for decorative purposes,
but also symbolically. The decorative use of color on the
stage is, obviously, like the decorative use of color in the design
of textiles, or stained glass, or posters. The symbolic use of
color is less easy to interpret, but it is plain that in most people's
minds red is connected with excitement and frenzy, and
blues and grays, with an atmosphere of mystery. This is a
very bald suggestion of some of the very subtle things that
have been done with color on the modern stage.</p>

<p>The new methods of stage lighting make possible all kinds
of color combinations and effects. The use of the plaster
horizon (or of the cyclorama, a cheaper substitute, usually a
straight semi-circular curtain enclosing the stage, made of either
white or light blue cloth), combined with high-powered lights
set at various angles on the stage, makes outdoor effects possible,
the beauty of which is new to the theatre.<a id="footnotetag15" name="footnotetag15"></a><a href="#footnote15" title="Go to footnote 15"><span class="smaller">[15]</span></a> Nowadays
footlights are not invariably discarded, but where they are
used they are wired so that groups of them can be lighted
when other sections are dimmed or darkened. When the setting
shows an interior scene with a window, though the scene
may be lighted from all sides, the window seems to be the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxxiv" name="pagexxxiv"></a>(p. xxxiv)</span> source of all light. A good deal of the lighting on the stage
is what is known in the interior decoration of houses as indirect
lighting; colored lights are produced most simply by the
interposition between the source of light and the stage of
transparent colored slides, gelatine or glass.</p>

<p>In any production that is made under the influence of the
new stagecraft, the costumes, like the setting of the play, are
considered in connection with the resources of lighting. The
costumes, whether historically correct or historically suggestive,
whether of a period or conventionalized, are conceived in their
three-fold relation to the characters of the play, the background,
and the scheme of lights, by the designer or the director
under whose general supervision the play is staged.</p>

<p>In general, American audiences are hardly conscious of the
existence of these reforms. Here and there, it is true, the
manager of a commercial theatre or an opera house has called
in an artist to supervise his productions and has thus given
publicity to the new way of making the arts of the theatre
work together. Certain Little Theatres, also, have educated
their followers in the significance of the new use of light and
design to represent the mood of a play. The demands that the
new method makes on craftsmanship have also commended it
to students in schools and colleges interested in play production.
Both the Little Theatres and the school theatres are
doing a real service when they educate their communities in
these new arts, for not only will this education increase the
capacity of these particular audiences to enjoy the good things
of the theatre, but the influence of these groups is bound in
the long run to popularize the new stagecraft.</p>


<h2>PLAYMAKING</h2>

<p>Shortly before the death of William Dean Howells, he related
the experience that he had had of being circularized by
a correspondence school that offered to teach him the art of
writing fiction in a phenomenally short time at a ridiculously
low rate. In this instance, there was something wrong with
the mailing list, but the fact remains that in universities successful
courses in writing short-stories and plays are given and
the best of these courses actually have turned out writers who
achieve various degrees of success financially and artistically
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxxv" name="pagexxxv"></a>(p. xxxv)</span> It is plain that a brief treatise like the present one makes no
such pretensions; it means merely to suggest some of the most
obvious points of departure for students in the drama who wish
to exercise themselves in the composition of the one-act play,
much as a student of poetry will try his hand at a <i>ballade</i> or
a sonnet without taking himself or his metrical exercises too
seriously.</p>

<p><i>The Seven Princesses.</i> Design by Robert Edmond Jones. An example of the
attempt to present the essential significant structure of a setting in the simplest
way conceivable and by so doing to stimulate the imagination of the spectator
to create for itself the imaginative environment of the play.</p>
</div>

<p>In the famous Perse School in Cambridge, England, the
boys begin at the age of twelve to practise playmaking as an
aid to the fuller understanding of Shakespeare's dramatic workmanship,
and this work is developed throughout the rest of the
course. The boys, having learned that Shakespeare himself
used stories that he found ready to hand, discover in their own
reading a story that will lend itself to dramatization. The
story is told and retold from every angle. The class is then
divided up into committees to every one of which is entrusted
some part of the dramatization. One little committee busies
itself with the setting, another with the structure, another with
the comic characters, another with the songs that are interspersed
and so on. These committees prepare rough notes to
be presented in class. These notes may propose an outline of
successive scenes, present the part of some principal character,
or the "business" (illustrative action) of some minor part.
Lessons of this sort are followed by composition rehearsals,
where the dramatic and literary value of the proposed plot,
characterization, pantomime, and dialogue are tested, and subjected
to the criticism of teacher and boys. In the next lessons,
the teacher brings to bear on the special problems on
which the boys are working all the criticism that his wider
range of reading and experience can suggest. In the light
of his suggestions the various points are debated and the boys
then proceed to careful fashioning, shaping, and writing. A
rehearsal of the nearly finished product is held, followed by a
final revision of the text. The work then goes forward to
a public performance given with all due ceremony. In the
higher classes playmaking is taught more especially in connection
with writing and the boys are trained to imitate the style
of various dramatists. Synge was used as a model at one time
for, as one of the masters of the school explained: "The style
of Synge is easy to copy because it is so largely composed of
a certain phraseology. The same words, phrases, and turns of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxxvi" name="pagexxxvi"></a>(p. xxxvi)</span> sentence occur again and again. Here are a few taken at
random; the reader will find them in a context on almost any
page of the plays: <i>It's myself</i>&mdash;<i>Is it me fight him?</i>&mdash;<i>I'm thinking</i>&mdash;<i>It's
a poor</i> (<i>fine, great, hard</i>, etc.) <i>thing</i>&mdash;<i>A little path
I have</i>&mdash;<i>Let you come</i>&mdash;<i>God help us all</i>&mdash;<i>Till Tuesday was
a week</i>&mdash;<i>The end of time</i>&mdash;<i>The dawn of day</i>&mdash;<i>Let on</i>&mdash;<i>Kindly</i>&mdash;<i>Now</i>,
as in <i>Walk out now</i>&mdash;<i>Surely</i>&mdash;<i>Maybe</i>&mdash;<i>Itself</i>&mdash;<i>At
all</i>&mdash;<i>Afeard</i>&mdash;<i>Destroyed</i>&mdash;<i>It curse</i>. Synge is also mighty
fond of the words <i>ditch</i> and <i>ewe</i>. And there are certain forms
of rhythm about Synge's prose which are used with equal frequency,
and are quick and easy to catch. So far from this imitation
of style being an artificial method, the fact is that once a boy
of sixteen or over has read a play or two of Synge's, if he has
any power of style in him, it will be all but impossible to stop
him writing like Synge for a few weeks." Learning playwriting
from models recalls the method of Benjamin Franklin and
Robert Louis Stevenson who in their youth wrote slavish imitations
of the great masters in order to form their own prose
style. Of course, it is not claimed that this work at the Perse
School makes playwrights, only that it gives the boys a deeper
appreciation of dramatic workmanship and furnishes a new
kind of intellectual game to add to the joy of school life.</p>

<p>The one-act plays contained in this collection are, as has
been suggested in what has been said about their construction,
illustrative of various kinds of workmanship. Certain of them
are excellent models for those who are experimenting with
playwriting. The one-act play, not nearly so difficult a form
as the full-length play, offers undergraduates in school and
college and inexperienced writers generally unlimited scope for
experiment.</p>

<p>The testimony of Lord Dunsany is to the effect that his play
is made when he has discovered a motive. Asked whether he
always began with a motive, "'Not always,' he said; 'I begin
with anything or next to nothing. Then suddenly, I get started,
and go through in a hurry. The main point is not to interrupt
a mood. Writing is an easy thing when one is going strong
and going fast; it becomes a hard thing only when the onward
rush is impeded. Most of my short plays have been written in
a sitting or two.'"<a id="footnotetag16" name="footnotetag16"></a><a href="#footnote16" title="Go to footnote 16"><span class="smaller">[16]</span></a> This passage is quoted because insight
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxxvii" name="pagexxxvii"></a>(p. xxxvii)</span> into the practice of professional writers is always helpful to
amateurs. Dunsany uses "motive," it seems, as a convenient
term for denoting the idea, the character, the incident or the
mood that impels the dramatist to start writing a play. Such
material is to be found everywhere. Many professional writers
accumulate vast stores of such themes against the day when they
may have the necessary leisure, energy, and insight to develop
them.</p>

<p>It has been pointed out that there are only thirty-six possible
dramatic situations in any case, and that no matter how the
plot shapes itself, it is bound to classify itself somehow or
other as one of the inescapable thirty-six. There is comfort
also in the suggestion that Shakespeare drew practically all the
dramatic material that he used so transcendently direct from
the familiar and accessible narrative stores of his day. The
young or inexperienced playwright need have no hesitation,
then, in turning to such sources as the Greek myths for inspiration.
Quite recently a highly successful one-act play of Phillip
Moeller's proved that Helen of Troy is as eternally interesting
as she is perennially beautiful. Maurice Baring draws on the
old Greek stories, too, for several of his <i>Diminutive Dramas</i>.
The Bible has proved dramatically suggestive to Lord Dunsany
and to Stephen Phillips. The old ballads of <i>Fair Annie</i> and
<i>The Wife of Usher's Well</i> have been found dramatically
available. The myths of the old Norse Gods, used by Richard
Wagner for his music dramas, contain much unmined dramatic
gold. John Masefield and Sigurjónsson have converted Saga
material to the uses of the drama. In old English literature,
in <i>Widsith</i>, in the <i>Battle of Brunanburh</i>, the seeking
dramatist may find. The romances of the Middle Ages, the
fairy lore of all peoples, and the old Hindu animal fables
are fertile in suggestion to the intending dramatist. What
a wonderful one-act play, steeped in the mellow atmosphere
of the Renaissance in Italy, might be made out of Browning's
<i>My Last Duchess!</i> At least one new literary precedent
has recently been created by the author who wrote a sequel
to <i>Dombey and Son</i>. Certainly many famous novels and
plays may be conceived as calling out for similar treatment
at the hands of the experimental playwright. Famous literary
and historic characters offer themselves as promising dramatic
material. When Robert Emmons Rogers, author of the well-known
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxxviii" name="pagexxxviii"></a>(p. xxxviii)</span> play, <i>Behind a Watteau Picture</i>, was a sophomore at
Harvard, he wrote the following charming little play on Shakespeare
which is reprinted here, with the author's permission, as
a pleasing example of a promising piece of apprentice work:<a id="footnotetag17" name="footnotetag17"></a><a href="#footnote17" title="Go to footnote 17"><span class="smaller">[17]</span></a></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> Nay, sir, but the brightest lad in Stratford. He

<p><span class="speaker">Peele</span> [<i>blankly</i>]. To what? [<i>A faint singing without.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>eagerly</i>]. Canst hear nothing&mdash;a lilt afar off?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Peele</span> [<i>nodding</i>]. Like a May-day catch? I hear it.</p>

There you can lie on your back in the grass under the high
arches of the trees, where the sun rarely peeps in, and you can
listen to the wind in the trees, and see it shake the blossoms
about you, and watch the red deer and the rabbits and the
birds&mdash;where everything is lovely and still. [<i>His voice trails

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span>. Reckoning now, sir? Wilt thou&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Peele</span>. Yes, yes, I go to-night. To-morrow Warwick, then
the long road to Oxford, playing by the way&mdash;and London
at last!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span>. And then? [<span class="smcap">Will</span> <i>listens intently.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Peele</span>. Then back to the old Blackfriars, where all the city
will flock to our tragedies and chronicles&mdash;a long, merry life
of it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>interested</i>]. And does the Queen ever come?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Peele</span>. Nay, child, we go to her. Last Christmas I played
before her at court, in the great room at Whitehall, before
the nobles and ambassadors and ladies&mdash;oh, a gay time&mdash;and
the Queen said&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will</span> [<i>starting up</i>]. What was the play?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span>. Eat thy supper, Will.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will</span> [<i>impatiently</i>]. I want no more.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Peele</span>. So my young cockerel is awake again. Will, a boy
of thy stamp is lost here in Stratford. Thou shouldst be in
London with us. By cock and pie, I have a mind to steal thee
for the company! [<i>Rises to pace the floor.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will</span> [<i>breathlessly</i>]. To play in London?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span>. Nay, Will, he but jests. Thou'rt happier here than
traipsing about wi' the players. [<span class="smcap">Giles</span> <i>appears at back.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Giles</span>. Nags be ready, zur, at sunset as thee'st bid. Shall
I put the gear on?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Peele</span> [<i>sharply</i>]. Well fed and groomed? Nay, I will see
them myself. [<span class="smcap">Giles</span> <i>vanishes.</i> <span class="smcap">Peele</span> <i>turns at the door.</i>]
Hark'ee, lass. Thy lad could do far worse than become a
player. Good meat and drink, gold in 's pouch, favor at court,
and true friends. I like the lad's spirit. [<i>He goes.</i> <span class="smcap">Anne</span>
<i>drops into his chair by the fire. Twilight is coming on rapidly.</i>
<span class="smcap">Will</span> <i>stands silent at the window looking after the player.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>troubled</i>]. Will, what is it? Thou'rt very strange
to-night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexliii" name="pagexliii"></a>(p. xliii)</span> <span class="speaker">Will</span> [<i>wistfully</i>]. I&mdash;I&mdash;Oh, Anne, I want to go to London.
I am a-weary of rusting in Stratford, where I can learn
nothing new, save to grow old, following my father's trade.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span>. But in London?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will</span> [<i>kindling</i>]. In London one can learn more marvels
in a day than in a lifetime here; for there the streets are in a
bustle all day long, and the whole world meets in them, soldiers
and courtiers and men of war, from France and Spain and the
new lands beyond the sea, all full of learning and pleasant tales
of foreign wars and the wondrous things in the colonies. My
schoolmaster told me of it. You can stand in St. Paul's and
the whole world passes by, mad for knowledge and adventure.
And then the stage-plays&mdash;!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span>. Oh, Will, why long for them?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will</span>. Think how splendid they must be when the Queen
herself loves to see 'em. If I were like this player-fellow, and
acted with the Admiral's company! He laughed that he would
take me with him&mdash;to be a player and perchance <i>write</i> plays,
interludes, and noble tragedies! Think of it, Anne&mdash;to live in
London and be one of all the rare company there, to write
brave plays wi' sounding lines for all to wonder at, and have
folk turn on the streets when I passed and whisper, "That be
Will Shakespeare, the play-maker"&mdash;to act them even at court
and gain the Queen's own thanks! Anne, London is so great
and splendid! It beckons me wi' all its turmoil of affairs and
its noble hearts ready to love a new comrade. [<i>Disconsolately</i>]
And I must bide in Stratford?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>gently</i>]. Come now, Will. No need to be so
feverish. Sit down by me. What canst thou know of play-making?
What canst thou do in London?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will</span> [<i>he sits down by the hearth at her feet, looking into
the firelight</i>]. I'll tell thee, Anne. Thy father and half the
village call me a lazy oaf, that I stray i' the woods some days
instead of helping my father. I canna help it. The fit comes
on me, and I must be alone, out i' the great woods.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>gladly</i>]. Then thou dost not poach?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will</span> [<i>hastily</i>]. No, no&mdash;that is&mdash;sometimes I am with
Hodge and Diccon and John a' Field, and 'tis hard not to
chase the deer. Nay, look not so grave&mdash;I try to do no harm.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>quietly</i>]. And when thou'rt alone?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will</span>. Then I lie under the trees or wander through the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexliv" name="pagexliv"></a>(p. xliv)</span> fields, and make plays to myself, as though I writ them in my
mind, and cry the lines forth to the birds&mdash;they sound nobly,
too&mdash;or make little songs and sing them i' the sunshine. They
are but dreams, I know, but splendid ones&mdash;and the player
looked wi' favor on me, and said I might make a good player,
and he would take me with him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span>. But he only jested.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will</span>. No jest to me! I'll take him at his word and go
with him to London. [<i>He starts up eagerly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>troubled</i>]. Will, Will! [<span class="smcap">Peele</span> <i>enters at the back.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Peele</span>. Hark 'ee, Giles, I go in half an hour!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will</span>. Master Peele! [<i>Catches at his arm.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Peele</span>. Well, youngster?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will</span> [<i>slowly</i>]. Thou&mdash;thou saidst I had a good spirit and
would do well in London&mdash;in a stage company. Thou wert
in jest, but&mdash;I will go with thee, if I may.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Peele</span> [<i>taken all aback</i>]. Go with me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will</span> [<i>earnestly</i>]. With the player's company&mdash;to London.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Peele</span> [<i>laughing</i>]. 'S wounds! Thou hast assurance! Dost
think to become a great player at once?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will</span> [<i>impatiently</i>]. Oh, I care not for the playing. Let
me but be in London, to see the people there and be near the
theatre. I'll be the players' servant, I'll hold the nobles' horses
in the street&mdash;I'll do anything!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Peele</span> [<i>seriously</i>]. And go with us all over England on
hard journeys to play to ignorant rustics?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will</span>. Anywhere&mdash;I'll follow on to the world's end&mdash;only
take me with you to London! [<i>As he speaks</i> <span class="smcap">Giles</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mistress
Shakespeare</span>, <i>a kindly faced woman of middle age,
dressed in housewife's cap and gown, appear at the door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Giles</span>. There 'e be, Mistress Shixpur.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mistress S.</span> [<i>as she enters</i>]. Oh, Will. [<i>He turns sharply.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will</span> [<i>confusedly</i>]. Mother! I&mdash;I&mdash;did not know thou
wert here.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mistress S.</span> Why didst not come home&mdash;and what dost
thou want with this stranger?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span>. He would go to London with him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mistress S.</span> [<i>aghast</i>]. To London. My Will?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will</span> [<i>quietly</i>]. Thou knowest, mother, what I ha' told
thee, things I told to no other, and now the good time has come
that I can see more of England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexlv" name="pagexlv"></a>(p. xlv)</span> <span class="speaker">Mistress S.</span> But I canna let thee go. Oh, Anne, I knew
the boy was restless, but I did not think for it so soon. He is
only a boy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will</span> [<i>coloring</i>]. In two years I shall be a man&mdash;I am a
man now in spirit. I canna stay in Stratford. [<span class="smcap">Mistress
Shakespeare</span> <i>sinks down in a chair.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mistress S.</span> What o' me? And, Will, 'twill break thy
father's heart! [<span class="smcap">Will</span> <i>looks ashamed.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will</span>. I know, he would not understand. 'Tis hard. He
must not know till I be gone.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mistress S.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Peele</span>]. Oh, sir, how could you wish to
lead the lad away? Hath not London enough a'ready?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Peele</span> [<i>who has been listening uncomfortably, faces her
gravely</i>]. I but played with the lad at first, till I saw how
earnest he was; then I would take him, for I loved his boldness.
But, boy, I'll tell thee fairly, thou'lt do better here.
Thou'st seen the brave side of it, the gay dresses, the good
horses, the cheering crowds and the court-favor. But 'tis dark
sometimes, too. The pouches often hang empty when the people
turn away&mdash;the lords are as the clouded sun, now smiling,
now cold&mdash;and there come the bitter days, when a man has no
friends but the pot-mates of the moment, when every man's
hand is against him for a vagabond and a rascal, when the
prison-gates lay ever wide before him, and the fickle folk, crying
after a <i>new</i> favorite, leave the old to starve.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span>. Will, canst not see? Thou'rt better here&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will</span> [<i>bravely</i>]. I know&mdash;all this may wait me&mdash;but I
must go.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mistress S.</span> [<i>alarmed</i>]. Must go, Will? [<i>He kneels by
her side.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will</span>. [<i>tenderly</i>]. Hush, mother, I'll tell thee. 'Tis not
entirely my longing, for this morning the keeper of old Lucy&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Giles</span>. Ha, poaching again, young scamp!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will</span>. Brought me before him&mdash;I was na poaching, I'll
swear it, not so much as chasing the deer&mdash;but Sir Thomas had
no patience, and bade me clear out, else he would seize me.
I&mdash;I&mdash;dare na stay.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mistress S.</span> I feared it; thy father forbade thee in the
great park. And now&mdash;Oh, Will, Will&mdash;I know well how
thou'st longed to go from here&mdash;and now thou must&mdash;what
shall I do, lacking thee?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexlvi" name="pagexlvi"></a>(p. xlvi)</span> <span class="speaker">Peele</span> [<i>frankly</i>]. Will, if thou must go, thou must. London
is greater than Stratford, and there is much evil there,
but thou'rt true-hearted, and&mdash;by my player's honor&mdash;I will
stand by thee, till the hangman get me. But we must go soon.
'Tis a dark road to Warwick&mdash;I'll see to the horses. Is it a
compact? [<span class="smcap">Will</span> <i>gives him his hands.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will</span> [<i>huskily</i>]. A compact, sir&mdash;to the end. [<span class="smcap">Peele</span> <i>hurries
out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Giles</span>. Look at 'e now, breaking 'is mother's heart, and
mad wi' joy to revel in London. 'Tis little 'e recks of she.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will</span> [<i>hotly</i>]. Thou liest. [<i>Bending over her</i>] Mother,
'tis not true. I do love thee and father, I love Stratford. I'll
never forget it. But 'tis so little here, and I must get away to
gain learning and do things i' the world, that I may bring
home all I get; fame, if God grant it, money, if I gain it, all
to those at home.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span>. Thou'rt over-confident.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will</span>. Aye, because I'm young. God knows there is
enough pain in London, and I'll get my share&mdash;but I'm <i>young</i>!
Mother, thou'rt not angry?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mistress S.</span> I knew 'twas coming, and 'tis not so hard.
We will always wait for thee at home, when thou'rt weary.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Giles</span> [<i>at the door</i>]. The horses are waiting. 'Tis dark,
Will.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will</span> [<i>breaking down</i>]. Mother, mother!</p>

us all.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will.</span> No, no, thou&mdash;I couldn't forget. I'll remember
thee, Anne&mdash;I'll put thee in my plays; all my young maids and
lovers shall be thee, as thou'rt now&mdash;and I'll bring thee rare
gifts when I come home.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span>. I do na want them. Will&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;did na mean to
be unkind. We were good friends, and I trust in thee, for the
future, that thou'lt be great. Good-by&mdash;and do na forget the
little playmate.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Will</span>. I will na forget [<i>kissing her</i>], and, Anne, be good to

<p class="ending">[THE CURTAIN.]</p>

<p>All the dramatic motives that have been enumerated so far
have been more or less literary in origin, but "A play may start
from almost anything: a detached thought that flashes through
the mind; a theory of conduct or an act which one firmly believes
or wishes only to examine; a bit of dialogue overheard
or imagined; a setting, real or imagined, which creates emotion
in the observer; a perfectly detached scene, the antecedents and
consequences of which are as yet unknown; a figure glimpsed
in a crowd which for some reason arrests the attention of the
dramatist ... a mere incident&mdash;heard in idle talk or observed;
a story told only in barest outline or with the utmost
detail."<a id="footnotetag18" name="footnotetag18"></a><a href="#footnote18" title="Go to footnote 18"><span class="smaller">[18]</span></a></p>

<p>The great dramatic critic, William Archer, has said that
"the only valid definition of the dramatic is: Any representation
of imaginary personages which is capable of interesting an
average audience assembled in a theater." For the purposes
of the definition the Boy Will of Robert Emmons Rogers's
little piece and Drinkwater's Abraham Lincoln are equally
imaginary personages. In the case of the one-act play the
theatre in question is more often than not a Little Theatre or
a school theatre, the representation is more frequently at the
moment by amateur than by professional actors and the audience,
being small and close to the stage, is likely to assume a co-operative
attitude towards the playwright, the actor, and the
other immediate factors in the production. Since the success
of a play depends on its adaptability to the requirements of
actor, theatre, and audience, it is well for inexperienced playwrights
to study the conditions under which one-act plays are
likely to be produced.</p>

<p>One very practical consideration to hold in mind is that the
one-act play has a shorter time in which to focus attention than
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexlviii" name="pagexlviii"></a>(p. xlviii)</span> the full-length play and so the indispensable preliminary exposition
must be quickly disposed of and an urgent appeal to the
emotional interest of the audience must be made at the beginning.
As has been said, every artistic consideration that calls
for singleness of impression in the short-story is of equal importance
in determining the unified structure of the one-act
play. For the reason that a one-act play is almost never given
by itself, if for no other, its effect will be dissipated if plot,
characterization, or atmosphere fails in unity.</p>

<p>The writer exercising himself in the art of play-making had
best begin with the procedure common to many professional
playwrights. This first step is the drawing up of a scenario,
which is an outline showing the course of the story, identifying
the characters, indicating the setting and atmosphere and explaining
the nature of the play; that is, whether, for example,
it is to be a fantasy like <i>The Pierrot of the Minute</i>, or a
comedy of manners like <i>Wurzel-Flummery</i>.</p>

<p>Here for instance is such a scenario as might have been

<li>Promises Anne rare gifts and kissing his mother goes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The scenario drawn up, the next step is to develop the plot.
The plot of a one-act play, to be effective, must be extraordinarily
compact. The accepted laws of plot construction for
all artistic narratives are the same. The climax must be
carefully prepared for, as in Synge's <i>Riders to the Sea</i>, and the
various devices used for heightening the suspense should be
discovered and applied.</p>

<p>Characterization is more difficult for the tyro to manage than
plot. Consistency of characterization is attained through discovering
in the beginning a motive that will sufficiently account
for the part taken by the character by means of speech and
action, and through constantly testing the characterization by
this motive. Such consistency of characterization is illustrated
to perfection in Tarkington's <i>Beauty and the Jacobin</i>. The
writer of the one-act play does not use many characters.
"Examination of several hundred one-act plays has revealed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagel" name="pagel"></a>(p. l)</span> that the average number of characters to a play is between
three and four."<a id="footnotetag19" name="footnotetag19"></a><a href="#footnote19" title="Go to footnote 19"><span class="smaller">[19]</span></a></p>

<p>Facility in writing dialogue is gained like facility in plot
construction and in characterization only by the patient study
of the work of experienced and successful playwrights. Dialogue
that is witty, charming, ironical, or graceful is of dramatic
value only as it is in character.</p>

<p>A little experience on the stage is a great help. Such experience
teaches the value of skillfully planned exits and entrances
for characters; helps the beginner to distinguish between
action that should be related and action that should be
seen; shows him how a scene must be devised to occupy the
time it takes for a character to appear after he has telephoned
that he is coming; and a variety of other practical considerations.</p>

<p>Stage directions are likely to be over-elaborated by the inexperienced.
The best stage directions are those that deal only
with matters of setting, lighting and essential pantomime or
action. They should not, in general, be used for characterization.</p>

<p>But after all there can be no infallible recipes for dramatic
writing. With the successful professional playwright,
apprenticeship is often an unconscious stage. Plays succeed
that break all the rules laid down by critics and professors of
dramatic literature, but after all those rules were, to begin
with, based on practices productive of success under other conditions.
In any case some insight into the mechanics of dramatic
art does make the reading of plays more interesting and
does give an added zest to theatre going.</p>


<h2>THE THEATRE IN THE SCHOOL</h2>

<p>The giving of plays in schools is no new thing. One of the
earliest English comedies, <i>Ralph Roister Doister</i>, was written
in the middle of the sixteenth century by Nicholas Udall, a
schoolmaster, probably to be performed at Westminister School
at Christmas time. Many generations of boys in the English
public schools have presented the plays of the Greek and Latin
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pageli" name="pageli"></a>(p. li)</span> dramatists; and schools and colleges in this country have also
at times given performances of the classic drama. But until
recently Shakespeare and the comedies of Sheridan and Goldsmith
have been the chief dramatic fare both in the classroom
and on the stage in American schools.</p>

<p>Modern plays are coming, however, to be more generally
introduced into the course of study. The following significant
list, prepared by Miss Anna H. Spaulding, is in use in the
senior classes in English in the Brookline High School, at
Brookline, Massachusetts:</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>Noah's Flood</li>
<li>Sacrifice of Isaac</li>
<li>Everyman</li>
<li>Everywoman</li>
<li>The Servant in the House</li>

<li>Tales of the Mermaid Tavern</li>
<li>Merchant of Venice</li>
<li>Jew of Malta</li>
<li>Tragedy of Shakespeare</li>

<li>The Scarecrow</li>
<li>The Piper</li>
<li>Milestones</li>
<li>The Importance of Being Earnest</li>
</ul>

<p>Thirty-five of these plays are distinctly modern. Another
list, in use as part of a course in contemporary literature given
in the last half of the third year at the Washington Irving
High School and including only modern plays, is reprinted
below:</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>The Blue Bird</li>
<li>The Melting Pot</li>
<li>Milestones</li>
<li>Justice, or</li>

<li>The Piper</li>
<li>Prunella</li>
<li>Sherwood</li>
<li>The Land of Heart's Desire</li>
<li>Spreading the News</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelii" name="pagelii"></a>(p. lii)</span> These plays are read and studied; that is to say, such topics
as dramatic workmanship, theme, setting, characterization, dialogue,
and diction are taken up in connection with each one
and each one is made the starting point for a new interest in
the drama of to-day.<a id="footnotetag20" name="footnotetag20"></a><a href="#footnote20" title="Go to footnote 20"><span class="smaller">[20]</span></a></p>

<p>In another high school in New York, the Evander Childs,
there is a four years' course of two periods a week in classroom
study of the drama, old and new. All composition work
is connected with this special interest.</p>

<p>Another kind of work based on contemporary drama was
carried on by a group of first-year students in a certain high
school who were much interested in a program of one-act
plays to be presented in the school theatre. The teacher
of English who had charge of this young class discussed the
subject of the theatre audience with them both before and
after the performance. The outcome of this analysis of the
interests of the audience was an outline. These fourteen-year
old girls said that the next time that they went to the theatre
they would keep in mind the following considerations:</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>I. In regard to the play:</li>
<li class="add2em">A. Its title</li>
<li class="add2em">B. Classification</li>
<li class="add2em">C. Plot</li>
<li class="add2em">D. Characterization</li>
<li class="add2em">E. Dialogue</li>
<li class="add2em">F. Theme</li>

<li>II. In regard to the actors:</li>
<li class="add2em">A. Their intelligence</li>
<li class="add2em">B. Clearness of speech</li>
<li class="add2em">C. Ease of manner</li>
<li class="add2em">D. Facial expression (appropriateness of make-up)</li>
<li class="add2em">E. Pantomime or action</li>
<li class="add4em">1. Posture</li>
<li class="add4em">2. Gesture</li>
<li class="add4em">3. Repose</li>
<li class="add2em"><span class="pagenum"><a id="pageliii" name="pageliii"></a>(p. liii)</span>   F. Costumes</li>
<li class="add4em">1. Appropriateness as an index to character</li>
<li class="add4em">2. Color and design</li>
<li class="add4em">3. Harmony with the setting</li>

<li>III. In regard to the setting:</li>
<li class="add2em">A. The lighting</li>
<li class="add2em">B. Color and design</li>
<li class="add2em">C. Appropriateness as regards mood of play</li>
<li class="add2em">D. Suggestiveness</li>
<li class="add2em">E. Workmanship</li>
</ul>

<p>One cannot help feeling that these young people were being
effectively trained to enjoy the best drama in the best way.</p>

<p>Not only is modern drama being read and studied in the
English classes, but the schools are becoming centres of Little
Theatre movements and leading their communities in pageants
and dramatic festivals. An editorial in <i>The New York Evening
Post</i> in 1918 put it in this way: "As Froude states that
in Tudor England there was acting everywhere from palace
to inn-yard and village green, so, the prediction is made, future
historians will record that in our America there was acting
everywhere&mdash;in neighborhood theatres, portable theatres, church
clubs, high schools and universities, settlements, open amphitheatres,
and hotel ballrooms."</p>

<p>One reason that amateur dramatics have taken on a new
lease of life in the schools is because other teachers besides
teachers of English have become interested in the project of
giving a play. Students in physics classes have planned and
executed lighting systems for the school theatre, students in
carpentering and manual arts have built the scenery from designs
made in drawing classes, curtains have been stenciled,
costumes made and cloths dyed in domestic art classes, programs
printed by the school printing squad, music furnished by
the school orchestra and dances taught by the physical training
department. In most cases the line coaching and the general
direction of the play have been part of the work in English.</p>

<p>A concrete example will illustrate this kind of co-operation.
Several years ago the department of English at the Washington
Irving High School gave two plays, <i>Three Pills in a Bottle</i>,
a product of the 47 Workshop, by Rachel Lyman Field, and
<i>The Goddess of the Woven Wind</i>, by Alice Rostetter. <i>The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pageliv" name="pageliv"></a>(p. liv)</span> Goddess of the Woven Wind</i> had grown out of class-room
work. The girls in an industrial course were studying the
origin of the silk industry. A pamphlet stated that the wife
of Hoangti, Si-Ling-Chi, was the first to prepare and weave
silk. This legend offered suggestive dramatic material peculiarly
appropriate for a girls' high school.</p>

<p>The work of obtaining the setting and the properties was
divided between two committees, each working under the direction
of a chairman. Since fifty dollars had been fixed as the
limit of expenditure for the two plays, the problem was rather
a difficult one. Fortunately, <i>Three Pills in a Bottle</i> calls for
a small cast. The cast of The <i>Goddess of the Woven Wind</i>,
however, included thirty-four girls, most of whom had to be
orientally clad and equipped. The teacher who contemplates
putting on a rather elaborate costume play in his or her
high school will be interested to learn that the amount was
so exactly fixed and the department so resourceful that fifty-one
dollars and nine cents was the total sum spent on the
two plays. Then, lest anyone think that there had been a miscalculation,
let it be added that this sum included the money
spent for hot chocolate to serve to the casts of the plays, between
the afternoon and evening performances.</p>

<p>The problem of staging <i>Three Pills in a Bottle</i> was greatly
simplified by the fact that the frontispiece of the play gives a
simple, effective setting not difficult to copy. With the aid of
some amateur carpentering, the regular interior set was easily
transformed to suit the purpose. The problem of color was
solved when the chairman of the committee found a patchwork
quilt in the attic, during a visit to her mother's home; a conference
with the janitress of her city apartment developed the
fact that she possessed a freshly scrubbed wash-tub, which she
was willing not only to donate to the cause, but to have painted
green.</p>

<p>The task of staging <i>The Goddess of the Woven Wind</i> was
difficult and interesting, because it was decidedly a costume
play, and because it was a first production. Some of the difficulties
that confronted the chairman of the committee for that
play were amusing.</p>

<p>For instance, after some perplexed thought on the subject,
she tacked the following list of costumes and properties on the
Bulletin Board of the English office:</p>

<ul class="none left30">
<li><span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelv" name="pagelv"></a>(p. lv)</span> WANTED:</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Mulberry tree</li>
<li>Gardener's spade</li>
<li>Teakwood stool</li>
<li>Chinese necklaces</li>
<li>Large, colorful abacus</li>
<li>Mandarin coats and hats</li>
<li>Sky-blue Chinese bowl</li>
<li>Chinese gong</li>
<li>Bamboo rod</li>
<li>Silk cocoons</li>
</ul>

<p>She also advertised the need of these things and many others
in all her classes. Within two weeks nearly everything had
either appeared or been promised, except a Chinese gong with
a proper "whang" to it, an unbreakable sky-blue bowl and
the mulberry tree! A teacher in a neighboring school lent
the company a splendid gong, sometimes used in their orchestra;
a student transformed a wooden chopping bowl by
means of clay and tempera into an exquisite piece of pottery,
copied from a priceless bowl on exhibition at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art.</p>

<p>The mulberry tree was still an unsolved problem, when
Dugald Stuart Walker, the artist who has produced a number
of plays at the Christadora House in New York, was consulted.
He suggested that the tree be a conventionalized one of flat
"drapes" of green and brown poplin, with cocoons sewn on
in a simple border design.</p>

<p>The staging of the play then became a project for members
of a third-year art class. During their English period they
read the play, recited on the subject of the China of remote
dynasties, constructed a miniature stage, and then, forming committees
among themselves, worked out the practical details.
One group purchased the necessary paint, another painted the
vermilion sun. Her neighbor affixed it to a bamboo rod. To
emphasize the Chinese setting, two girls made a frame with a
dragon as head-piece and huge, colorful Chinese medallions
to be sewn on the side drapery. The design for the medallions
was obtained from a Chinese brass plate. Almost every girl
in the class took part in the project. Interest was easily aroused,
as a number of girls in this class took part in the play.</p>

<p>As for the costumes, for the thirty-four members of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelvi" name="pagelvi"></a>(p. lvi)</span> cast, only eight dollars' worth was hired. The rest were
either borrowed or made by the girls. The most successful
one, perhaps, that worn by the empress, was copied from an
Edmund Dulac illustration of the Princess Badoura. The
astrologers' costumes were obtained from photographs of <i>The
Yellow Jacket</i>, lent by Mrs. Coburn. To complete the project,
the girls wrote a composition explaining how to organize the
staging of a costume play.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the selection and coaching of the two casts was
going on. Competition for the parts was open to the girls of
the entire school. A great many girls were tried out before
the two committees made a choice. In fact, every girl who
was recommended by her English teacher was given an opportunity
to read a part. In a number of cases two girls were
assigned for one part and it was not known until almost the
last moment who was to have the rôle or who was to understudy.
Rehearsals were held at least three times a week, for
three weeks, and a full-dress rehearsal was held two days before
the final performance. It was thought advisable to allow
a day to elapse between the last rehearsal and the real performance,
in order to give the girls an opportunity to rest.</p>

<p>In coaching the plays, an effort was made to have a girl read
the line properly without having it read to her. The members
of the coaching committee would explain the mood or frame
of mind to the speaker; the girl would then interpret the mood
in her reading.</p>

<p>In addition to the coaching committee, several teachers sat at
the back of the auditorium during rehearsals, to warn the
speakers when they could not be heard.</p>

<p>The advertising campaign began soon after a choice of plays
had been made. In compliance with the request of the Publicity
Committee, one of the teachers of an art class and a
teacher in the English Department assigned to their pupils the
problem of making posters to advertise the plays. To the
painter of the best one a prize was awarded.</p>

<p>Announcements of the play were posted by pupils in various
parts of the building. Tiny brochures decorated with Chinese
motives were prepared by students during an English period,
and later were circulated among the faculty, and placed upon
office bulletin boards, and in diaries. In writing these
brochures the girls applied the knowledge they had gained in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelvii" name="pagelvii"></a>(p. lvii)</span> studying the writing of advertisements. Two illustrated advertisements
made in one class were displayed in other high
schools; a number were sent in an envelope with tickets to
patrons and distinguished friends of the schools. One class
wrote letters to firms of wholesale silk merchants and importers,
advertising <i>The Goddess of the Woven Wind</i>, the
story of silk.</p>

<p>In order to increase the sale of tickets and to prepare an
appreciative audience, various subjects were suggested to English
teachers for projects in class work connected with the plays.
In many classes every girl wrote and illustrated a paper on
some topic pertaining to Chinese life, such as customs, costumes,
religion, occupations, silk, China, umbrellas, fireworks,
fans, position of women, objects of art. Oral compositions
were devoted to phases of some of these subjects. In the oral
work and in the written composition, accurate knowledge of
authorities consulted was insisted upon. Chinese proverbs were
studied. "A man knows, but a woman knows better," used
by the author in her play, was one of the most popular ones.
Translations, found in the <i>Literary Digest</i>, of Chinese poems
of the sixteenth and of the eighteenth century were produced
and read by the girls, many of whom brought to class all the
Chinese articles they could find at home. Incense burners, fans,
pitchers, embroideries, chop sticks, beads, shoes, vases, and even
a Chinese newspaper, found their way to the class-room and
were exhibited with pride. Interest in things Chinese was so
great that clippings and prints continued coming in for almost
two weeks after the play had been presented. Class visits were
made to the Chinese exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art and to importing houses in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>The kind of co-operation described has led in some schools to
the establishment of workshops similar to those conducted in connection
with certain university courses in playwriting and dramatics
and with many of the Little Theatres. A paragraph that
appeared recently in a calendar of the New York Drama League
explains in a convincing way the necessity for a workshop in
connection with all amateur producing. "One of the most
vital problems that the amateur group has to solve," says the
writer, "is that of securing a proper place for the preparing of
a production. Not all organizations can hold rehearsals, paint
scenery, experiment with lighting on costumes and scenery on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelviii" name="pagelviii"></a>(p. lviii)</span> the stage on which they are finally to play. Even where this
is possible, it is costly. Much of the activity is now carried on
in the homes of members so far as rehearsals go; in barns or
garages as regards the painting of scenery and not at all so far
as the lighting question is concerned. More often than not,
a few hasty final rehearsals are relied upon to pull into shape
some of the most important elements of a satisfactory performance.</p>

<p>"The remedy lies in the acquisition of a workshop. A large
room with a very high ceiling will serve admirably. But you
must be able to work recklessly in it, sawing wood, hammering
nails, mussing things up generally with paint and riddling the
walls and ceiling with hooks and screws to hang lighting apparatus
and other properties. An old-fashioned barn can be
converted into an ideal workshop, if provision is made for
proper heating. All the activity should be concentrated in the
workshop and there is no reason why all the experimentalists
cannot be at work at once&mdash;the carpenters, the scene painters,
the electricians, the property men, and even the actors with
their director."</p>

<p>The use of miniature model stages is becoming more and
more common in the schools, the preliminary model serving the
workshop, until the background, lighting, properties, and costumes
are completed. It is an excellent thing for schools to
start a collection of models of famous theatres and notably successful
stage-sets. The material for these exists in illustrated
books and magazines and in the mass of descriptive material in
regard to the stage that is now being published.<a id="footnotetag21" name="footnotetag21"></a><a href="#footnote21" title="Go to footnote 21"><span class="smaller">[21]</span></a></p>

<p>Exterior of the Beechwood Theatre.</p>
</div>

<p>Two school theatres designed especially for the purpose of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelix" name="pagelix"></a>(p. lix)</span> fostering in the schools to which they are attached an interest
in the drama are the Garden Theatre of the high school at
Montclair, New Jersey, and the Beechwood Theatre in the private
school at Scarborough-on-Hudson, New York, built by
Frank A. Vanderlip. At Montclair the present high school
building was completed in 1914. To the northeast of the building
at that time was a ravine which afforded a natural amphitheatre.
The site was perfect, and a gift from a public-spirited citizen,
Mrs. Henry Lang, made it possible to create on this spot a
very artistic and beautiful place for outdoor performances, either
plays or pageants.</p>

<p>On the slope nearest the building are semi-circular rows of
concrete seats accommodating about fifteen hundred people. A
brook spanned by two arched bridges separates the audience
from the stage. Back of the turf stage is a graveled stage
slightly raised and reached by two flights of steps. The pergola
and trees make a beautiful background. The house in the rear
is a part of the plant and is used for dressing and make-up.</p>

<p>The Beechwood Theatre within the school has a proscenium
opening of twenty-seven feet and a stage depth, back to the
plaster horizon, of the same dimensions. There are two complete
sets of drapery, one of coarse écru linen and one of blue
velvet; there is also a stock drawing-room set of thirty pieces.
Back of the stage are ten dressing-rooms. The lighting arrangements
are extraordinarily complete: the theatre has a
standard electrical equipment of footlights and borders and a
switchboard of the best type to which has recently been added
the latest lighting devices, consisting of an X-ray border, the
end section of which is on a separate dimmer, a thousand-watt
centre floodlight, six five-hundred watt-spotlights, each on
separate dimmers, in the false proscenium or tormentor,<a id="footnotetag22" name="footnotetag22"></a><a href="#footnote22" title="Go to footnote 22"><span class="smaller">[22]</span></a> and
a line of one-thousand-watt floodlights for lighting the plaster
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelx" name="pagelx"></a>(p. lx)</span> sky. All of this recently added equipment is controlled from
a separate portable switchboard.</p>

<p>Though this plant was built primarily for the school, it is used
also by the Beechwood Players, a Little Theatre organization,
and by other community clubs which comprise an orchestra, a
chorus, a group interested in the fine arts, and a poetry circle.
Mr. Vanderlip looks forward to the development of a school
of the arts of the theatre from the nucleus of the Beechwood
community clubs. With this idea in mind he has just built
a workshop for the Beechwood Players in a separate building.
It contains power woodworking machines, and rooms for painting
scenery and for the costume department, the latter containing
power sewing machines.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but that these two schools have unique
facilities for developing an interest in the acted drama. But
artistic results have often been secured in the school theatre
with equipment falling far short of the ideal standards achieved
at Montclair and at Scarborough. Other less fortunate schools
are, moreover, at no particular disadvantage when it comes to
the class-room study of the drama for which this book is primarily
planned, this work being the first step in the direction
of a more intelligent attitude toward modern plays and modern
theatres. A class-room reading of modern plays without any
accessories, as Shakespeare is often read from the seats and the
aisles, is one of the most practical methods of speech and voice
improvement. Louis Calvert, the eminent actor, speaking of
this kind of training says: "After all it is one of the simplest
things in the world to learn to speak correctly, to take thought
and begin and end each word properly.... A little attention
to one's everyday conversation will often work wonders.
If one schools himself for a while to speak a little more slowly,
and to give each syllable its due, it is surprising how naturally
and rapidly his speech will clarify. If we take care of the
consonants, the vowels will take care of themselves."</p>

<p>At the present time, then, the theatre in the schools means
a variety of things. It means first and foremost, as suggested
by the latest college entrance requirements, the study of modern
plays, side by side with the classics. It means also the improvement
of English speech, through the interpretation and the
reading aloud of the text. It means a study of the new art
of the theatre such as the present book suggests. It means often
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxi" name="pagelxi"></a>(p. lxi)</span> the presentation of plays before outside audiences and the consequent
strengthening of the ties that should exist between the
school and the community. It may mean the co-operation of
several departments of the school in the production; and, in
this case, it usually results in the establishment of some kind
of a workshop. And finally, in certain favored schools, it
means the erection of model Little Theatres. It seems fair to
suppose that this newly aroused interest in modern drama and
in modern methods of production in the schools will have far-reaching
results.</p>

BOOTH TARKINGTON</span></h1>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page003" name="page003"></a>(p. 003)</span> Since the days of Edward Eggleston, Indiana has been accumulating
literary traditions until at the present time it rivals
New England in the variety of its literary associations. Newton
Booth Tarkington, born in Indianapolis in 1869, and continuing
to make his home there still in the old family house
on North Pennsylvania Street, is one of the most distinguished
of the Hoosier writers. As a lad of eleven he began his friendship
with James Whitcomb Riley, then a neighbor. "He
acknowledges (shaking his head in reflection at the depth of
it) that the spirit of Riley has exercised over him a strong, if
often unconsciously felt, influence all his life." The delicious
stories of Penrod and of the William Sylvanus Baxter of <i>Seventeen</i>
that Booth Tarkington has told for the unalloyed delight
of old and young are said to reproduce quite accurately the
author's recollection of his own boyhood pranks and associations
in the Middle-Western city of his birth. Tarkington went first
to Phillips Exeter Academy and later to Purdue University
at Lafayette, Indiana, before he became a member of the class
of '93 at Princeton. His popularity and his good fellowship
are still cherished memories on the campus.</p>

<p>It seems that he was infallibly associated in the undergraduate
mind with the singing of <i>Danny Deever</i>; so much so, that
whenever he appeared on the steps at Nassau Hall there would
be an immediate demand for his speciality, a demand that often
caused him to retire as inconspicuously as possible from the
crowd. These old days are commemorated in the following
verses, a copy of which, framed, hangs on the walls of the
Princeton Club in New York.</p>

<p>No biography of Booth Tarkington, no matter how brief,
should omit to mention that he was elected to the Indiana State
Legislature and sat for a time in that body, where he accumulated,
no doubt, some data on the subject of Indiana politics
that he may afterwards have put to literary use.</p>

<p>He has found the subject for most of his novels and plays<a id="footnotetag24" name="footnotetag24"></a><a href="#footnote24" title="Go to footnote 24"><span class="smaller">[24]</span></a>
in contemporary American life, which he treats unsentimentally,
spiritedly, and vigorously. <i>Beauty and the Jacobin</i>, like his
famous and fascinating tale, <i>Monsieur Beaucaire</i>, is exceptional
among his works in deserting the modern American scene for
an Eighteenth Century situation. The story and the play are
likely, for this reason, to be compared. The tone of <i>Monsieur
Beaucaire</i> is more urbane, more whimsical, more romantic than
the mood of <i>Beauty and the Jacobin</i> which "breaks with the
pretty, pretty kind of thing. There is a new quality in the
texture of the writing.... The plot here springs directly
from character, and the action of the piece is inevitable. <i>Beauty
and the Jacobin</i> gives evidence of being the first conscious and
determined, as it is the first consistent, effort of the author to
leave the surface and work from the inside of his characters
out.... The whole of the little drama is scintillant with
wit, delicate and at times brilliant and somewhat Shavian, which
flashes out poignantly against the sombreness of its background."<a id="footnotetag25" name="footnotetag25"></a><a href="#footnote25" title="Go to footnote 25"><span class="smaller">[25]</span></a></p>

<p><i>Beauty and the Jacobin</i> was published in 1912 and has had
at least one performance on the professional stage. On November
12, 1912, it was played by members of the company
then acting in <i>Fanny's First Play</i>, at a matinée at the Comedy
Theatre, in New York. It has always been a favorite with
amateurs and quite recently was performed in St. Louis by one
of the dramatic clubs of that city.</p>


<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page005" name="page005"></a>(p. 005)</span> BEAUTY AND THE JACOBIN</h2>


<p class="opening"><i><span class="min10pc">Our scene is in a rusty lodging-house of the Lower Town,</span>
Boulogne-sur-Mer, and the time, the early twilight of dark
November in northern France. This particular November
is dark indeed, for it is November of the year 1793,
Frimaire of the Terror. The garret room disclosed to
us, like the evening lowering outside its one window, and
like the times, is mysterious, obscure, smoked with perplexing
shadows; these flying and staggering to echo the
shiftings of a young man writing at a desk by the light
of a candle.</i></p>

<p class="opening"><i><span class="min10pc">We are just under the eaves here;</span> the dim ceiling slants; and
there are two doors: that in the rear wall is closed; the
other, upon our right, and evidently leading to an inner
chamber, we find ajar. The furniture of this mean apartment
is chipped, faded, insecure, yet still possessed of a
haggard elegance; shamed odds and ends, cheaply acquired
by the proprietor of the lodging-house, no doubt at an
auction of the confiscated leavings of some emigrant noble.
The single window, square and mustily curtained, is so
small that it cannot be imagined to admit much light on
the brightest of days; however, it might afford a lodger
a limited view of the houses opposite and the street below.
In fact, as our eyes grow accustomed to the obscurity we
discover it serving this very purpose at the present moment,
for a tall woman stands close by in the shadow, peering
between the curtains with the distrustfulness of a picket
thrown far out into an enemy's country. Her coarse
blouse and skirt, new and as ill-fitting as sacks, her shop-woman's
bonnet and cheap veil, and her rough shoes are
naïvely denied by her sensitive, pale hands and the high-bred
and in-bred face, long profoundly marked by loss
and fear, and now very white, very watchful. She is not
more than forty, but her hair, glimpsed beneath the clumsy
bonnet, shows much grayer than need be at that age. This
is</i> <span class="smcap">Anne de Laseyne</span>.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page006" name="page006"></a>(p. 006)</span> <p class="opening"><i><span class="min10pc">The intent young man at the desk, easily recognizable as her
brother,</span> fair and of a singular physical delicacy, is a finely
completed product of his race; one would pronounce him
gentle in each sense of the word. His costume rivals his
sister's in the innocence of its attempt at disguise: he wears
a carefully soiled carter's frock, rough new gaiters, and
a pair of dangerously aristocratic shoes, which are not too
dusty to conceal the fact that they are of excellent make
and lately sported buckles. A tousled cap of rabbit-skin,
exhibiting a tricolor cockade, crowns these anomalies,
though not at present his thin, blond curls, for it has been
tossed upon a dressing-table which stands against the wall
to the left. He is younger than</i> <span class="smcap">Madame de Laseyne</span>,
<i>probably by more than ten years; and, though his features
so strikingly resemble hers, they are free from the permanent
impress of pain which she bears like a mourning-badge
upon her own.</i></p>

<p class="opening"><i><span class="min10pc">He is expending a feverish attention upon his task,</span> but with
patently unsatisfactory results; for he whispers and mutters
to himself, bites the feather of his pen, shakes his head
forebodingly, and again and again crumples a written sheet
and throws it upon the floor. Whenever this happens</i>
<span class="smcap">Anne de Laseyne</span> <i>casts a white glance at him over her
shoulder&mdash;his desk is in the center of the room&mdash;her
anxiety is visibly increased, and the temptation to speak
less and less easily controlled, until at last she gives way
to it. Her voice is low and hurried.</i></p>

<div class="gettys">
<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span>. Louis, it is growing dark very fast.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span>. I had not observed it, my sister. [<i>He lights a
second candle from the first; then, pen in mouth, scratches at
his writing with a little knife.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span>. People are still crowding in front of the wine-shop
across the street.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>smiling with one side of his mouth</i>]. Naturally.
Reading the list of the proscribed that came at noon. Also
waiting, amiable vultures, for the next bulletin from Paris.
It will give the names of those guillotined day before yesterday.
For a good bet: our own names [<i>he nods toward the other
room</i>]&mdash;yes, hers, too&mdash;are all three in the former. As for
the latter&mdash;well, they can't get us in that now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page007" name="page007"></a>(p. 007)</span> <span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>eagerly</i>]. Then you are certain that we are safe?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> I am certain only that they cannot murder us day
before yesterday. [<i>As he bends his head to his writing a
woman comes in languidly through the open door, bearing an
armful of garments, among which one catches the gleam of
fine silk, glimpses of lace and rich furs&mdash;a disordered burden
which she dumps pell-mell into a large portmanteau lying open
upon a chair near the desk. This new-comer is of a startling
gold-and-ivory beauty; a beauty quite literally striking, for at
the very first glance the whole force of it hits the beholder like
a snowball in the eye; a beauty so obvious, so completed, so
rounded, that it is painful; a beauty to rivet the unenvious stare
of women, but from the full blast of which either king or
man-peasant would stagger away to the confessional. The
egregious luster of it is not breathed upon even by its overspreading
of sullen revolt, as its possessor carelessly arranges
the garments in the portmanteau. She wears a dress all gray,
of a coarse texture, but exquisitely fitted to her; nothing could
possibly be plainer, or of a more revealing simplicity. She might
be twenty-two; at least it is certain that she is not thirty.
At her coming,</i> <span class="smcap">Louis</span> <i>looks up with a sigh of poignant wistfulness,
evidently a habit; for as he leans back to watch her he
sighs again. She does not so much as glance at him, but speaks
absently to</i> <span class="smcap">Madame de Laseyne</span>. <i>Her voice is superb, as it
should be; deep and musical, with a faint, silvery huskiness.</i>]

<p class="p2"><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>the new-comer</i>]. Is he still there?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> I lost sight of him in the crowd. I think he has
gone. If only he does not come back!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>with grim conviction</i>]. He will.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> I am trying to hope not.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise.</span> I have told you from the first that you overestimate
his importance. Haven't I said it often enough?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>under her breath</i>]. You have!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>coldly</i>]. He will not harm you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>looking out of the window</i>]. More people down
there; they are running to the wine-shop.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> Gentle idlers! [<i>The sound of triumphant shouting
comes up from the street below.</i>] That means that the
list of the guillotined has arrived from Paris.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>shivering</i>]. They are posting it in the wine-shop window.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page008" name="page008"></a>(p. 008)</span> [<i>The shouting increases suddenly to a roar of hilarity,
in which the shrilling of women mingles.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> Ah! One remarks that the list is a long one. The
good people are well satisfied with it. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Eloise</span>] My cousin,
in this amiable populace which you champion, do you never
scent something of&mdash;well, something of the graveyard scavenger?
[<i>She offers the response of an unmoved glance in his
direction, and slowly goes out by the door at which she entered.
Louis sighs again and returns to his scribbling.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>nervously</i>]. Haven't you finished, Louis?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>indicating the floor strewn with crumpled slips of
paper</i>]. A dozen.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> Not good enough?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>with a rueful smile</i>]. I have lived to discover that
among all the disadvantages of being a Peer of France the
most dangerous is that one is so poor a forger. Truly, however,
our parents are not to be blamed for neglecting to have
me instructed in this art; evidently they perceived I had no
talent for it. [<i>Lifting a sheet from the desk.</i>] Oh, vile! I
am not even an amateur. [<i>He leans back, tapping the paper
thoughtfully with his pen.</i>] Do you suppose the Fates took all
the trouble to make the Revolution simply to teach me that I
have no skill in forgery? Listen. [<i>He reads what he has
written.</i>] "Committee of Public Safety. In the name of the
Republic. To all Officers, Civil and Military: Permit the
Citizen Balsage"&mdash;that's myself, remember&mdash;"and the Citizeness
Virginie Balsage, his sister"&mdash;that's you, Anne&mdash;"and
the Citizeness Marie Balsage, his second sister"&mdash;that is
Eloise, you understand&mdash;"to embark in the vessel <i>Jeune
Pierrette</i> from the port of Boulogne for Barcelona. Signed:
Billaud Varennes. Carnot. Robespierre." Execrable! [<i>He
tears up the paper, scattering the fragments on the floor.</i>] I
am not even sure it is the proper form. Ah, that Dossonville!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> But Dossonville helped us&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> At a price. Dossonville! An individual of marked
attainment, not only in penmanship, but in the art of plausibility.
Before I paid him he swore that the passports he forged
for us would take us not only out of Paris, but out of the
country.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> Are you sure we must have a separate permit to
embark?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page009" name="page009"></a>(p. 009)</span> <span class="speaker">Louis.</span> The captain of the <i>Jeune Pierrette</i> sent one of his
sailors to tell me. There is a new Commissioner from the National
Committee, he said, and a special order was issued this
morning. They have an officer and a file of the National
Guard on the quay to see that the order is obeyed.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> But we bought passports in Paris. Why can't we
here?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> Send out a street-crier for an accomplished forger?
My poor Anne! We can only hope that the lieutenant on the
quay may be drunk when he examines my dreadful "permit."
Pray a great thirst upon him, my sister! [<i>He looks at a watch
which he draws from beneath his frock.</i>] Four o'clock. At
five the tide in the river is poised at its highest; then it must
run out, and the <i>Jeune Pierrette</i> with it. We have an hour.
I return to my crime. [<i>He takes a fresh sheet of paper and
begins to write.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>urgently</i>]. Hurry, Louis!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> Watch for Master Spy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> I cannot see him. [<i>There is silence for a time,
broken only by the nervous scratching of Louis's pen.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>at work</i>]. Still you don't see him?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> No. The people are dispersing. They seem in a
good humor.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> Ah, if they knew&mdash;[<i>He breaks off, examines his
latest effort attentively, and finds it unsatisfactory, as is evinced
by the noiseless whistle of disgust to which his lips form themselves.
He discards the sheet and begins another, speaking
rather absently as he does so.</i>] I suppose I have the distinction
to be one of the most hated men in our country, now that all
the decent people have left it&mdash;so many by a road something
of the shortest! Yes, these merry gentlemen below there would
be still merrier if they knew they had within their reach a forfeited
"Emigrant." I wonder how long it would take them
to climb the breakneck flights to our door. Lord, there'd be
a race for it! Prize-money, too, I fancy, for the first with his
bludgeon.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>lamentably</i>]. Louis, Louis! Why didn't you lie
safe in England?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. Anne, Anne! I had to come back for a
good sister of mine.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> But I could have escaped alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page010" name="page010"></a>(p. 010)</span> <span class="speaker">Louis</span>. That is it&mdash;"alone"! [<i>He lowers his voice as he
glances toward the open door.</i>] For she would not have moved
at all if I hadn't come to bully her into it. A fanatic, a fanatic!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>brusquely</i>]. She is a fool. Therefore be patient
with her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>warningly</i>]. Hush.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>in a loud, careless tone from the other room</i>]. Oh,
I heard you! What does it matter? [<i>She returns, carrying
a handsome skirt and bodice of brocade and a woman's long
mantle of light-green cloth, hooded and lined with fur. She
drops them into the portmanteau and closes it.</i>] There!
I've finished your packing for you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>rising</i>]. My cousin, I regret that we could not
provide servants for this flight. [<i>Bowing formally.</i>] I regret
that we have been compelled to ask you to do a share of
what is necessary.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>turning to go out again</i>]. That all?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>lifting the portmanteau</i>]. I fear&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>with assumed fatigue</i>]. Yes, you usually do.
What now?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>flushing painfully</i>]. The portmanteau is too heavy.
[<i>He returns to the desk, sits, and busies himself with his writing,
keeping his grieved face from her view.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span>. You mean you're too weak to carry it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span>. Suppose at the last moment it becomes necessary to
hasten exceedingly&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span>. You mean, suppose you had to run, you'd throw
away the portmanteau. [<i>Contemptuously.</i>] Oh, I don't doubt
you'd do it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>forcing himself to look up at her cheerfully</i>]. I
dislike to leave my baggage upon the field, but in case of a
rout it might be a temptation&mdash;if it were an impediment.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>peremptorily</i>]. Don't waste time. Lighten the portmanteau.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span>. You may take out everything of mine.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span>. There's nothing of yours in it except your cloak.
You don't suppose&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span>. Take out that heavy brocade of mine.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span>. Thank you for not wishing to take out my fur-lined
cloak and freezing me at sea!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>gently</i>]. Take out both the cloak and the dress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page011" name="page011"></a>(p. 011)</span> <span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>astounded</i>]. What!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> You shall have mine. It is as warm, but not so
heavy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>angrily</i>]. Oh, I am sick of your eternal packing
and unpacking! I am sick of it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> Watch at the window, then. [<i>She goes swiftly to
the portmanteau, opens it, tosses out the green mantle and the
brocaded skirt and bodice, and tests the weight of the portmanteau.</i>]
I think it will be light enough now, Louis.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> Do not leave those things in sight. If our landlord
should come in&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> I'll hide them in the bed in the next room. Eloise!
[<i>She points imperiously to the window.</i> <span class="smcap">Eloise</span> <i>goes to it
slowly and for a moment makes a scornful pretense of being
on watch there; but as soon as</i> <span class="smcap">Madame de Laseyne</span> <i>has left
the room she turns, leaning against the wall and regarding
Louis with languid amusement. He continues to struggle
with his ill-omened "permit," but, by and by, becoming aware
of her gaze, glances consciously over his shoulder and meets her
half-veiled eyes. Coloring, he looks away, stares dreamily at
nothing, sighs, and finally writes again, absently, like a man
under a spell, which, indeed, he is. The pen drops from his
hand with a faint click upon the floor. He makes the movement
of a person suddenly awakened, and, holding his last writing
near one of the candles, examines it critically. Then he
breaks into low, bitter laughter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>unwillingly curious</i>]. You find something amusing?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> Myself. One of my mistakes, that is all.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>indifferently</i>]. Your mirth must be indefatigable
if you can still laugh at those.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> I agree. I am a history of error.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise.</span> You should have made it a vocation; it is your one
genius. And yet&mdash;truly because I am a fool I think, as Anne
says&mdash;I let you hector me into a sillier mistake than any of
yours.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> When?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>flinging out her arms</i>]. Oh, when I consented to
this absurd journey, this <i>tiresome</i> journey&mdash;with <i>you</i>! An
"escape"? From nothing. In "disguise." Which doesn't
disguise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page012" name="page012"></a>(p. 012)</span> <span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>his voice taut with the effort for self-command</i>].
My sister asked me to be patient with you, Eloise&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise.</span> Because I am a fool, yes. Thanks. [<i>Shrewishly.</i>]
And then, my worthy young man? [<i>He rises abruptly, smarting
almost beyond endurance.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>breathing deeply</i>]. Have I not been patient with
you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>with a flash of energy</i>]. If <i>I</i> have asked you to be
anything whatever&mdash;with me!&mdash;pray recall the petition to my
memory.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>beginning to let himself go</i>]. Patient! Have I ever
been anything but patient with you? Was I not patient with
you five years ago when you first harangued us on your "Rights
of Man" and your monstrous republicanism? Where you got
hold of it all I don't know&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>kindling</i>]. Ideas, my friend. Naturally, incomprehensible
to you. Books! Brains! Men!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> "Books! Brains! Men!" Treason, poison, and
mobs! Oh, I could laugh at you then: they were only beginning
to kill us, and I was patient. Was I not patient with
you when these Republicans of yours drove us from our homes,
from our country, stole all we had, assassinated us in dozens,
in hundreds, murdered our King? [<i>He walks the floor, gesticulating
nervously.</i>] When I saw relative after relative of
my own&mdash;aye, and of yours, too&mdash;dragged to the abattoir&mdash;even
poor, harmless, kind André de Laseyne, whom they took
simply because he was my brother-in-law&mdash;was I not patient?
And when I came back to Paris for you and Anne, and had
to lie hid in a stable, every hour in greater danger because you
would not be persuaded to join us, was I not patient? And
when you finally did consent, but protested every step of the
way, pouting and&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>stung</i>]. "Pouting!"</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> And when that stranger came posting after us so
obvious a spy&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>scornfully</i>]. Pooh! He is nothing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> Is there a league between here and Paris over which
he has not dogged us? By diligence, on horseback, on foot,
turning up at every posting-house, every roadside inn, the while
you laughed at me because I read death in his face! These
two days we have been here, is there an hour when you could
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page013" name="page013"></a>(p. 013)</span> look from that window except to see him grinning up from
the wine-shop door down there?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>impatiently, but with a somewhat conscious expression</i>].
I tell you not to fear him. There is nothing
in it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>looking at her keenly</i>]. Be sure I understand why
you do not think him a spy! You believe he has followed us
because you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise.</span> I expected that! Oh, I knew it would come!
[<i>Furiously.</i>] I never saw the man before in my life!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>pacing the floor</i>]. He is unmistakable; his trade is
stamped on him; a hired trailer of your precious "Nation's."</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>haughtily</i>]. The Nation is the People. You
malign because you fear. The People is sacred!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>with increasing bitterness</i>]. Aren't you tired yet of
the Palais Royal platitudes? I have been patient with your
Mericourtisms for so long. Yes, always I was patient. Always
there was time; there was danger, but there was a little
time. [<i>He faces her, his voice becoming louder, his gestures
more vehement.</i>] But now the <i>Jeune Pierrette</i> sails this hour,
and if we are not out of here and on her deck when she leaves
the quay, my head rolls in Samson's basket within the week,
with Anne's and your own to follow! <i>Now</i>, I tell you, there
is no more time, and <i>now</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>suavely</i>]. Yes? Well? "Now?" [<i>He checks
himself; his lifted hand falls to his side.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>in a gentle voice</i>]. I am still patient. [<i>He looks
into her eyes, makes her a low and formal obeisance, and drops
dejectedly into the chair at the desk.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>dangerously</i>]. Is the oration concluded?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> Quite.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>suddenly volcanic</i>]. Then "<i>now</i>" you'll perhaps
be "patient" enough to explain why I shouldn't leave you instantly.
Understand fully that I have come thus far with you
and Anne solely to protect you in case you were suspected.
"<i>Now</i>," my little man, you are safe: you have only to go on
board your vessel. Why should I go with you? Why do you
insist on dragging me out of the country?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>wearily</i>]. Only to save your life; that is all.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise.</span> My life! Tut! My life is safe with the People&mdash;my
People! [<i>She draws herself up magnificently.</i>] The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page014" name="page014"></a>(p. 014)</span> Nation would protect me! I gave the people my whole fortune
when they were starving. After that, who in France dare
lay a finger upon the Citizeness Eloise d'Anville!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span>. I have the idea sometimes, my cousin, that perhaps
if you had not given them your property they would have
taken it, anyway. [<i>Dryly.</i>] They did mine.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>agitated</i>]. I do not expect you to comprehend what
I felt&mdash;what I feel! [<i>She lifts her arms longingly.</i>] Oh, for
a Man!&mdash;a Man who could understand me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>sadly</i>]. That excludes me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span>. Shall I spell it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span>. You are right. So far from understanding you, I
understand nothing. The age is too modern for me. I do not
understand why this rabble is permitted to rule France; I do
not even understand why it is permitted to live.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>with superiority</i>]. Because you belong to the class
that thought itself made of porcelain and the rest of the world
clay. It is simple: the mud-ball breaks the vase.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span>. You belong to the same class, even to the same
family.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span>. You are wrong. One circumstance proves me no
aristocrat.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span>. What circumstance?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span>. That I happened to be born with brains. I can
account for it only by supposing some hushed-up ancestral
scandal. [<i>Brusquely.</i>] Do you understand that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span>. I overlook it. [<i>He writes again.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span>. Quibbling was always a habit of yours. [<i>Snapping
at him irritably.</i>] Oh, stop that writing! You can't do
it, and you don't need it. You blame the people because they
turn on you now, after you've whipped and beaten and ground
them underfoot for centuries and centuries and&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span>. Quite a career for a man of twenty-nine!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span>. I have said that quibbling was&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>despondently</i>]. Perhaps it is. To return to my
other deficiencies, I do not understand why this spy who followed
us from Paris has not arrested me long before now. I
do not understand why you hate me. I do not understand
the world in general. And in particular I do not understand
the art of forgery. [<i>He throws down his pen.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span>. You talk of "patience"! How often have I explained
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page015" name="page015"></a>(p. 015)</span> that you would not need passports of any kind if you
would let me throw off my incognito. If anyone questions
you, it will be sufficient if I give my name. All France knows
the Citizeness Eloise d'Anville. Do you suppose the officer on
the quay would dare oppose&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>with a gesture of resignation</i>]. I know you think it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>angrily</i>]. You tempt me not to prove it. But for
Anne's sake&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> Not for mine. That, at least, I understand. [<i>He
rises.</i>] My dear cousin, I am going to be very serious&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise.</span> O heaven! [<i>She flings away from him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>plaintively</i>]. I shall not make another oration&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise.</span> Make anything you choose. [<i>Drumming the floor
with her foot.</i>] What does it matter?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> I have a presentiment&mdash;I ask you to listen&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>in her irritation almost screaming</i>]. How can I
help but listen? And Anne, too! [<i>With a short laugh.</i>] You
know as well as I do that when that door is open everything
you say in this room is heard in there. [<i>She points to the open
doorway, where</i> <span class="smcap">Madame de Laseyne</span> <i>instantly makes her
appearance, and after exchanging one fiery glance with</i> <span class="smcap">Eloise</span>
<i>as swiftly withdraws, closing the door behind her with outraged
emphasis.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>breaking into a laugh</i>]. Forward, soldiers!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>reprovingly</i>]. Eloise!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise.</span> Well, <i>open</i> the door, then, if you want her to hear
you make love to me! [<i>Coolly.</i>] That's what you're going
to do, isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>with imperfect self-control</i>]. I wish to ask you for
the last time&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>flouting</i>]. There are so many last times!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> To ask you if you are sure that you know your own
heart. You cared for me once, and&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>as if this were news indeed</i>]. I did? Who under
heaven ever told you that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>flushing</i>]. You allowed yourself to be betrothed to
me, I believe.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise.</span> "Allowed" is the word, precisely. I seem to recall
changing all that the very day I became an orphan&mdash;and my
own master! [<i>Satirically polite.</i>] Pray correct me if my
memory errs. How long ago was it? Six years? Seven?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page016" name="page016"></a>(p. 016)</span> <span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>with emotion</i>]. Eloise, Eloise, you did love me then!
We were happy, both of us, so very happy&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>sourly</i>]. "Both!" My faith! But I must have
been a brave little actress.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> I do not believe it. You loved me. I&mdash;[<i>He
hesitates.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise.</span> Do get on with what you have to say.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>in a low voice</i>]. I have many forebodings, Eloise,
but the strongest&mdash;and for me the saddest&mdash;is that this is the
last chance you will ever have to tell&mdash;to tell me&mdash;[<i>He falters
again.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>irritated beyond measure, shouting</i>]. To tell you
what?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>swallowing</i>]. That your love for me still lingers.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>promptly</i>]. Well, it doesn't. So <i>that's</i> over!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> Not quite yet. I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>dropping into a chair</i>]. O Death!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>still gently</i>]. Listen. I have hope that you and
Anne may be permitted to escape; but as for me, since the first
moment I felt the eyes of that spy from Paris upon me I have
had the premonition that I would be taken back&mdash;to the guillotine,
Eloise. I am sure that he will arrest me when I attempt
to leave this place to-night. [<i>With sorrowful earnestness.</i>]
And it is with the certainty in my soul that this is our last hour
together that I ask you if you cannot tell me that the old love
has come back. Is there nothing in your heart for me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise.</span> Was there anything in <i>your</i> heart for the beggar
who stood at your door in the old days?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> Is there nothing for him who stands at yours now,
begging for a word?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>frowning</i>]. I remember you had the name of a
disciplinarian in your regiment. [<i>She rises to face him.</i>] Did
you ever find anything in your heart for the soldiers you ordered
tied up and flogged? Was there anything in your heart for the
peasants who starved in your fields?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>quietly</i>]. No; it was too full of you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise.</span> Words! Pretty little words!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> Thoughts. Pretty, because they are of you. All, always
of you&mdash;always, my dear. I never really think of anything
but you. The picture of you is always before the eyes
of my soul; the very name of you is forever in my heart.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page017" name="page017"></a>(p. 017)</span> [<i>With a rueful smile.</i>] And it is on the tips of my fingers,
sometimes when it shouldn't be. See. [<i>He steps to the desk
and shows her a scribbled sheet.</i>] This is what I laughed at
a while ago. I tried to write, with you near me, and unconsciously
I let your name creep into my very forgery! I wrote
it as I wrote it in the sand when we were children; as I have
traced it a thousand times on coated mirrors&mdash;on frosted windows.
[<i>He reads the writing aloud.</i>] "Permit the Citizen
Balsage and his sister, the Citizeness Virginie Balsage, and
his second sister, the Citizeness Marie Balsage, and Eloise
d'Anville"&mdash;so I wrote!&mdash;"to embark upon the vessel <i>Jeune
Pierrette</i>&mdash;" You see? [<i>He lets the paper fall upon the
desk.</i>] Even in this danger, that I feel closer and closer with
every passing second, your name came in of itself. I am like
that English Mary: if they will open my heart when I am
dead, they shall find, not "Calais," but "Eloise"!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>going to the dressing-table</i>]. Louis, that doesn't
interest me. [<i>She adds a delicate touch or two to her hair,
studying it thoughtfully in the dressing-table mirror.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>somberly</i>]. I told you long ago&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>smiling at her reflection</i>]. So you did&mdash;often!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>breathing quickly</i>]. I have nothing new to offer.
I understand. I bore you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise.</span> Louis, to be frank: I don't care what they find
in your heart when they open it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>with a hint of sternness</i>]. Have you never reflected
that there might be something for me to forgive you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>glancing at him over her shoulder in frowning surprise</i>].
What!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> I wonder sometimes if you have ever found a flaw
in your own character.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>astounded</i>]. So! [<i>Turning sharply upon him.</i>]
You are assuming the right to criticize me, are you? Oho!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>agitated</i>]. I state merely&mdash;I have said&mdash;I think I
forgive you a great deal&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>beginning to char</i>]. You do! You bestow your
gracious pardon upon me, do you? [<i>Bursting into flame.</i>]
Keep your forgiveness to yourself! When I want it I'll kneel
at your feet and beg it of you! You can <i>kiss</i> me then, for then
you will know that "the old love has come back"!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>miserably</i>]. When you kneel&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page018" name="page018"></a>(p. 018)</span> <span class="speaker">Eloise.</span> Can you picture it&mdash;<i>Marquis?</i> [<i>She hurls his title
at him, and draws herself up in icy splendor.</i>] I am a woman
of the Republic!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> And the Republic has no need of love.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise.</span> Its daughter has no need of yours!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> Until you kneel to me. You have spoken. It is
ended. [<i>Turning from her with a pathetic gesture of farewell
and resignation, his attention is suddenly arrested by something
invisible. He stands for a moment transfixed. When
he speaks, it is in an altered tone, light and at the same time
ominous.</i>] My cousin, suffer the final petition of a bore. Forgive
my seriousness; forgive my stupidity, for I believe that
what one hears now means that a number of things are indeed
ended. Myself among them.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>not comprehending</i>]. "What one hears?"</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>slowly</i>]. In the distance. [<i>Both stand motionless
to listen, and the room is silent. Gradually a muffled, multitudinous
sound, at first very faint, becomes audible.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise.</span> What is it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>with pale composure</i>]. Only a song! [<i>The distant
sound becomes distinguishable as a singing from many unmusical
throats and pitched in every key, a drum-beat booming
underneath; a tumultuous rumble which grows slowly louder.
The door of the inner room opens, and</i> <span class="smcap">Madame de Laseyne</span>
<i>enters.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>briskly, as she comes in</i>]. I have hidden the cloak
and the dress beneath the mattress. Have you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>lifting his hand</i>]. Listen! [<i>She halts, startled. The
singing, the drums, and the tumult swell suddenly much louder,
as if the noise-makers had turned a corner.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>crying out</i>]. The "Marseillaise"!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> The "Vultures' Chorus"!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>in a ringing voice</i>]. The Hymn of Liberty!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>trembling violently</i>]. It grows louder.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> Nearer!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>running to the window</i>]. They are coming this
way!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>rushing ahead of her</i>]. They have turned the corner
of the street. Keep back, Louis!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>leaning out of the window, enthusiastically</i>]. <i>Vive
la</i>&mdash;[<i>She finishes with an indignant gurgle as</i> <span class="smcap">Anne de
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page019" name="page019"></a>(p. 019)</span> Laseyne</span>, <i>without comment, claps a prompt hand over her
mouth and pushes her vigorously from the window.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> A mob&mdash;carrying torches and dancing. [<i>Her voice
shaking wildly.</i>] They are following a troop of soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> The National Guard.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> Keep back from the window! A man in a tricolor
scarf marching in front.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> A political, then&mdash;an official of their government.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> O Virgin, have mercy! [<i>She turns a stricken face
upon her brother.</i>] It is that&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis</span> [<i>biting his nails</i>]. Of course. Our spy. [<i>He takes
a hesitating step toward the desk; but swings about, goes to the
door at the rear, shoots the bolt back and forth, apparently
unable to decide upon a course of action; finally leaves the door
bolted and examines the hinges.</i> <span class="smcap">Anne</span>, <i>meanwhile, has hurried
to the desk, and, seizing a candle there, begins to light
others in a candelabrum on the dressing-table. The noise outside
grows to an uproar; the "Marseillaise" changes to
"Ça ira"; and a shaft of the glare from the torches below
shoots through the window and becomes a staggering red patch
on the ceiling.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>feverishly</i>]. Lights! Light those candles in the
sconce, Eloise! Light all the candles we have. [<span class="smcap">Eloise</span>, <i>resentful,
does not move.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> No, no! Put them out!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> Oh, fatal! [<i>She stops him as he rushes to obey his
own command.</i>] If our window is lighted he will believe we
have no thought of leaving, and pass by. [<i>She hastily lights
the candles in a sconce upon the wall as she speaks; the shabby
place is now brightly illuminated.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> He will not pass by. [<i>The external tumult culminates
in riotous yelling, as, with a final roll, the drums cease
to beat.</i> <span class="smcap">Madame de Laseyne</span> <i>runs again to the window.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>sullenly</i>]. You are disturbing yourselves without
reason. They will not stop here.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>in a sickly whisper</i>]. They have stopped.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> At the door of this house? [<span class="smcap">Madame de Laseyne</span>,
<i>leaning against the wall, is unable to reply, save by a gesture.
The noise from the street dwindles to a confused, expectant
murmur.</i> <span class="smcap">Louis</span> <i>takes a pistol from beneath his blouse, strides
to the door, and listens.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page020" name="page020"></a>(p. 020)</span> <span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>faintly</i>]. He is in the house. The soldiers followed
him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> They are on the lower stairs. [<i>He turns to the two
women humbly.</i>] My sister and my cousin, my poor plans
have only made everything worse for you. I cannot ask you
to forgive me. We are caught.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>vitalized with the energy of desperation</i>]. Not till
the very last shred of hope is gone. [<i>She springs to the desk
and begins to tear the discarded sheets into minute fragments.</i>]
Is that door fastened?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> They'll break it down, of course.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> Where is our passport from Paris?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> Here. [<i>He gives it to her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> Quick! Which of these "permits" is the best?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> They're all hopeless&mdash;[<i>He fumbles among the
sheets on the desk.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> Any of them. We can't stop to select. [<i>She thrusts
the passport and a haphazard sheet from the desk into the
bosom of her dress. An orderly tramping of heavy shoes and
a clinking of metal become audible as the soldiers ascend the
upper flight of stairs.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise.</span> All this is childish. [<i>Haughtily.</i>] I shall merely
announce&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>uttering a half-choked scream of rage</i>]. You'll announce
nothing! Out of here, both of you!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> No, no!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>with breathless rapidity, as the noise on the stairs
grows louder</i>]. Let them break the door in if they will; only
let them find me alone. [<i>She seizes her brother's arm imploringly
as he pauses, uncertain.</i>] Give me the chance to make
them think I am here alone.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Louis.</span> I can't&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>urging him to the inner door</i>]. Is there any other
possible hope for us? Is there any other possible way to gain
even a little time? Louis, I want your word of honor not to
leave that room unless I summon you. I must have it! [<i>Overborne
by her intensity,</i> <span class="smcap">Louis</span> <i>nods despairingly, allowing her
to force him toward the other room. The tramping of the
soldiers, much louder and very close, comes to a sudden stop.

on the floor just beyond the outer door.</i>]</p>

them, and leans against it, panting. The knocking is repeated.
She braces herself to speak.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>with a catch in her throat</i>]. Who is&mdash;there?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">A Sonorous Voice.</span> French Republic!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>faltering</i>]. It is&mdash;it is difficult to hear. What do
you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">The Voice.</span> Open the door.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>more firmly</i>]. That is impossible.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">The Voice.</span> Open the door.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> What is your name?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">The Voice.</span> Valsin, National Agent.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> I do not know you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">The Voice.</span> Open!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> I am here alone. I am dressing. I can admit no one.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">The Voice.</span> For the last time: open!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> No!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">The Voice.</span> Break it down. [<i>A thunder of blows from
the butts of muskets falls upon the door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>rushing toward it in a passion of protest</i>]. No, no,
no! You shall not come in! I tell you I have not finished
dressing. If you are men of honor&mdash;Ah! [<i>She recoils, gasping,
as a panel breaks in, the stock of a musket following it;
and then, weakened at rusty bolt and crazy hinge, the whole
door gives way and falls crashing into the room. The narrow
passage thus revealed is crowded with shabbily uniformed soldiers
of the National Guard, under an officer armed with a
saber. As the door falls a man wearing a tricolor scarf
strides by them, and, standing beneath the dismantled lintel,
his hands behind him, sweeps the room with a smiling eye.</i></p>

<p><i>This personage is handsomely, almost dandiacally dressed in
black; his ruffle is of lace, his stockings are of silk; the lapels
of his waistcoat, overlapping those of his long coat, exhibit a
rich embroidery of white and crimson. These and other details
of elegance, such as his wearing powder upon his dark hair,
indicate either insane daring or an importance quite overwhelming.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page022" name="page022"></a>(p. 022)</span> A certain easy power in his unusually brilliant eyes
favors the probability that, like Robespierre, he can wear what
he pleases. Undeniably he has distinction. Equally undeniable
is something in his air that is dapper and impish and lurking.
His first glance over the room apparently affording him acute
satisfaction, he steps lightly across the prostrate door,</i> <span class="smcap">Madame
de Laseyne</span> <i>retreating before him but keeping herself between
him and the inner door. He comes to an unexpected halt in a
dancing-master's posture, removing his huge hat&mdash;which displays
a tricolor plume of ostrich feathers&mdash;with a wide flourish,
an intentional burlesque of the old-court manner.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> Permit me. [<i>He bows elaborately.</i>] Be gracious
to a recent fellow-traveler. I introduce myself. At your
service: Valsin, Agent of the National Committee of Public
Safety. [<i>He faces about sharply.</i>] Soldiers! [<i>They stand at
attention.</i>] To the street door. I will conduct the examination
alone. My assistant will wait on this floor, at the top of
the stair. Send the people away down below there, officer.
Look to the courtyard. Clear the streets. [<i>The officer salutes,
gives a word of command, and the soldiers shoulder their muskets,
march off, and are heard clanking down the stairs.</i>
<span class="smcap">Valsin</span> <i>tosses his hat upon the desk, and turns smilingly to
the trembling but determined</i> <span class="smcap">Madame de Laseyne</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>summoning her indignation</i>]. How dare you break
down my door! How dare you force your&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>suavely</i>]. My compliments on the celerity with
which the citizeness has completed her toilet. Marvelous. An
example to her sex.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> You intend robbery, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>with a curt laugh</i>]. Not precisely.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> What, then?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span>. I have come principally for the returned Emigrant,
Louis Valny-Cherault, formerly called Marquis de Valny-Cherault,
formerly of the former regiment of Valny; also formerly&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>cutting him off sharply</i>]. I do not know what you
mean by all these names&mdash;and "formerlies"!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> No? [<i>Persuasively.</i>] Citizeness, pray assert that
I did not encounter you last week on your journey from
Paris&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>hastily</i>]. It is true I have been to Paris on business;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page023" name="page023"></a>(p. 023)</span> you may have seen me&mdash;I do not know. Is it a crime to return
from Paris?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>in a tone of mock encouragement</i>]. It will amuse
me to hear you declare that I did not see you traveling in company
with Louis Valny-Cherault. Come! Say it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>stepping back defensively, closer to the inner door</i>].
I am alone, I tell you! I do not know what you mean. If
you saw me speaking with people in the diligence, or at some
posting-house, they were only traveling acquaintances. I did
not know them. I am a widow&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> My condolences. Poor, of course?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> And lonely, of course? [<i>Apologetically.</i>] Loneliness
is in the formula: I suggest it for fear you might forget.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>doggedly</i>]. I am alone.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> Quite right.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>confusedly</i>]. I am a widow, I tell you&mdash;a widow,
living here quietly with&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>taking her up quickly</i>]. Ah&mdash;"with"! Living
here alone, and also "with"&mdash;whom? Not your late husband?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>desperately</i>]. With my niece.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>affecting great surprise</i>]. Ah! A niece! And the
niece, I take it, is in your other room yonder?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>huskily</i>]. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>taking a step forward</i>]. Is she pretty? [<span class="smcap">Anne</span>
<i>places her back against the closed door, facing him grimly. He
assumes a tone of indulgence.</i>] Ah, one must not look: the
niece, likewise, has not completed her toilet.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> She is&mdash;asleep.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>glancing toward the dismantled doorway</i>]. A
sound napper! Why did you not say instead that she was&mdash;shaving?
[<i>He advances, smiling.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>between her teeth</i>]. You shall not go in! You cannot
see her! She is&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>laughing</i>]. Allow me to prompt you. She is not
only asleep; she is ill. She is starving. Also, I cannot go in
because she is an orphan. Surely, she is an orphan? A lonely
widow and her lonely orphan niece. Ah, touching&mdash;and
sweet!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>hotly</i>]. What authority have you to force your way
into my apartment and insult&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page024" name="page024"></a>(p. 024)</span> <span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>touching his scarf</i>]. I had the honor to mention
the French Republic.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> So! Does the French Republic persecute widows
and orphans?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>gravely</i>]. No. It is the making of them!</p>

<span class="smcap">Anne</span> [<i>crying out</i>]. Ah, horrible!

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> I regret that its just severity was the cause of your
own bereavement, Citizeness. When your unfortunate husband,
André, formerly known as the Prince de Laseyne&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>defiantly, though tears have sprung to her eyes</i>]. I
tell you I do not know what you mean by these titles. My
name is Balsage.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> Bravo! The Widow Balsage, living here in calm
obscurity with her niece. Widow Balsage, answer quickly,
without stopping to think. [<i>Sharply.</i>] How long have you
lived here?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> Two months. [<i>Faltering.</i>]&mdash;A year!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>laughing</i>]. Good. Two months and a year! No
visitors? No strangers?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>wheeling quickly and picking up</i> <span class="smcap">Louis's</span> <i>cap
from the dressing-table</i>]. This cap, then, belongs to your
niece.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>flustered, advancing toward him as if to take it</i>]. It
was&mdash;it was left here this afternoon by our landlord.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>musingly</i>]. That is very, very puzzling. [<i>He
leans against the dressing-table in a careless attitude, his back
to her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>cavalierly</i>]. Why "puzzling"?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> Because I sent him on an errand to Paris this
morning. [<i>She flinches, but he does not turn to look at her,
continuing in a tone of idle curiosity.</i>] I suppose your own
excursion to Paris was quite an event for you, Widow Balsage.
You do not take many journeys?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> I am too poor.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> And you have not been contemplating another departure
from Boulogne?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>still in the same careless attitude, his back toward
her and the closed door</i>]. Good. It is as I thought: the portmanteau
is for ornament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page025" name="page025"></a>(p. 025)</span> <span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>choking</i>]. It belongs to my niece. She came only
an hour ago. She has not unpacked.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> Naturally. Too ill.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> She had traveled all night; she was exhausted. She
went to sleep at once.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> Is she a somnambulist?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>taken aback</i>]. Why?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>indifferently</i>]. She has just opened the door of her
room in order to overhear our conversation. [<i>Waving his hand
to the dressing-table mirror, in which he had been gazing.</i>]
Observe it, Citizeness Laseyne.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>demoralized</i>]. I do not&mdash;I&mdash;[<i>Stamping her foot.</i>]
How often shall I tell you my name is Balsage!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>turning to her apologetically</i>]. My wretched
memory. Perhaps I might remember better if I saw it written:
I beg a glance at your papers. Doubtless you have your certificate
of citizenship&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>trembling</i>]. I have papers, certainly.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span>. The sight of them&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> I have my passport; you shall see. [<i>With wildly
shaking hands she takes from her blouse the passport and the
"permit," crumpled together.</i>] It is in proper form&mdash;[<i>She
is nervously replacing the two papers in her bosom when with a
sudden movement he takes them from her. She cries out incoherently,
and attempts to recapture them.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>extending his left arm to fend her off</i>]. Yes,
here you have your passport. And there you have others.
[<i>He points to the littered floor under the desk.</i>] Many of
them!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> Old letters! [<i>She clutches at the papers in his
grasp.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>easily fending her off</i>]. Doubtless! [<i>He shakes the
"permit" open.</i>] Oho! A permission to embark&mdash;and signed
by three names of the highest celebrity. Alas, these unfortunate
statesmen, Billaud Varennes, Carnot, and Robespierre! Each
has lately suffered an injury to his right hand. What a misfortune
for France! And what a coincidence! One has not
heard the like since we closed the theatres.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>furiously struggling to reach his hand</i>]. Give me
my papers! Give me&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>holding them away from her</i>]. You see, these unlucky
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page026" name="page026"></a>(p. 026)</span> great men had their names signed for them by somebody
else. And I should judge that this somebody else
must have been writing quite recently&mdash;less than half an
hour ago, from the freshness of the ink&mdash;and in considerable
haste; perhaps suffering considerable anguish of mind, Widow
Balsage! [<span class="smcap">Madame de Laseyne</span>, <i>overwhelmed, sinks into
a chair. He comes close to her, his manner changing startlingly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>bending over with sudden menace, his voice loud
and harsh</i>]. Widow Balsage, if you intend no journey, why
have you this forged permission to embark on the Jeune
Pierrette? Widow Balsage, who is the Citizen Balsage?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>faintly</i>]. My brother.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>straightening up</i>]. Your first truth. [<i>Resuming
his gaiety.</i>] Of course he is not in that room yonder with your
niece.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>brokenly</i>]. No, no, no; he is not! He is not here.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>commiseratingly</i>]. Poor woman! You have not
even the pleasure to perceive how droll you are.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span>. I perceive that I am a fool! [<i>She dashes the tears
from her eyes and springs to her feet.</i>] I also perceive that you
have denounced us before the authorities here&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> Pardon. In Boulogne it happens that <i>I</i> am the
authority. I introduce myself for the third time: Valsin, Commissioner
of the National Committee of Public Safety. Tallien
was sent to Bordeaux; Collot to Lyons; I to Boulogne. Citizeness,
were all of the august names on your permit genuine,
you could no more leave this port without my counter-signature
than you could take wing and fly over the Channel!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>with a shrill laugh of triumph</i>]. You have overreached
yourself! You're an ordinary spy: you followed us
from Paris&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>gaily</i>]. Oh, I intended you to notice that!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>unheeding</i>]. You have claimed to be Commissioner
of the highest power in France. We can prove that you are a
common spy. You may go to the guillotine for that. Take
care, Citizen! So! You have denounced us; we denounce you.
I'll have you arrested by your own soldiers. I'll call them&mdash;
[<i>She makes a feint of running to the window. He watches her
coolly, in silence; and she halts, chagrined.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>pleasantly</i>]. I was sure you would not force me to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page027" name="page027"></a>(p. 027)</span> be premature. Remark it, Citizeness Laseyne: I am enjoying
all this. I have waited a long time for it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>becoming hysterical</i>]. I am the Widow Balsage, I
tell you! You do not know us&mdash;you followed us from Paris.
[<i>Half sobbing.</i>] You're a spy&mdash;a hanger-on of the police. We
will prove&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>stepping to the dismantled doorway</i>]. I left my
assistant within hearing&mdash;a species of animal of mine. I may
claim that he belongs to me. A worthy patriot, but skillful,
who has had the honor of a slight acquaintance with you, I believe.
[<i>Calling.</i>] Dossonville! [<span class="smcap">Dossonville</span>, <i>a large man,
flabby of flesh, loose-mouthed, grizzled, carelessly dressed,
makes his appearance in the doorway. He has a harsh and
reckless eye; and, obviously a flamboyant bully by temperament,
his abject, doggish deference to</i> <span class="smcap">Valsin</span> <i>is instantly impressive,
more than confirming the latter's remark that</i> <span class="smcap">Dossonville</span>
<i>"belongs" to him.</i> <span class="smcap">Dossonville</span>, <i>apparently, is a chattel indeed,
body and soul. At sight of him</i> <span class="smcap">Madame de Laseyne</span>
<i>catches at the desk for support and stands speechless.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>easily</i>]. Dossonville, you may inform the Citizeness
Laseyne what office I have the fortune to hold.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dossonville</span> [<i>coming in</i>]. Bright heaven! All the world
knows that you are the representative of the Committee of Public
Safety. Commissioner to Boulogne.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> With what authority?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dossonville.</span> Absolute&mdash;unlimited! Naturally. What else
would be useful?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> You recall this woman, Dossonville?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dossonville.</span> She was present when I delivered the passport
to the Emigrant Valny-Cherault, in Paris.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> Did you forge that passport?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dossonville.</span> No. I told the Emigrant I had. Under
orders. [<i>Grinning.</i>] It was genuine.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> Where did you get it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dossonville.</span> From you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>suavely</i>]. Sit down, Dossonville. [<i>The latter, who
is standing by a chair, obeys with a promptness more than military.</i>
<span class="smcap">Valsin</span> <i>turns smilingly to</i> <span class="smcap">Madame de Laseyne</span>.] Dossonville's
instructions, however, did not include a "permit" to
sail on the <i>Jeune Pierrette</i>. All of which, I confess, Citizeness,
has very much the appearance of a trap! [<i>He tosses the two
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page028" name="page028"></a>(p. 028)</span> papers upon the desk. Utterly dismayed, she makes no effort
to secure them. He regards her with quizzical enjoyment.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne.</span> Ah&mdash;you&mdash;[<i>She fails to speak coherently.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> Dossonville has done very well. He procured your
passport, brought your "disguises," planned your journey, even
gave you directions how to find these lodgings in Boulogne. Indeed,
I instructed him to omit nothing for your comfort. [<i>He
pauses for a moment.</i>] If I am a spy, Citizeness Laseyne, at
least I trust your gracious intelligence may not cling to the
epithet "ordinary." My soul! but I appear to myself a most
uncommon type of spy&mdash;a very intricate, complete, and unusual
spy, in fact.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>to herself, weeping</i>]. Ah, poor Louis!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>cheerfully</i>]. You are beginning to comprehend?
That is well. Your niece's door is still ajar by the discreet
width of a finger, so I assume that the Emigrant also begins to
comprehend. Therefore I take my ease! [<i>He seats himself in
the most comfortable chair in the room, crossing his legs in a
leisurely attitude, and lightly drumming the tips of his fingers
together, the while his peaceful gaze is fixed upon the ceiling.
His tone, as he continues, is casual.</i>] You understand, my Dossonville,
having long ago occupied this very apartment myself,
I am serenely aware that the Emigrant can leave the other
room only by the window; and as this is the fourth floor, and
a proper number of bayonets in the courtyard below are arranged
to receive any person active enough to descend by a rope
of bed-clothes, one is confident that the said Emigrant will
remain where he is. Let us make ourselves comfortable, for
it is a delightful hour&mdash;an hour I have long promised myself.
I am in a good humor. Let us all be happy. Citizeness
Laseyne, enjoy yourself. Call me some bad names!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>between her teeth</i>]. If I could find one evil enough!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>slapping his knee delightedly</i>]. There it is: the
complete incompetence of your class. You poor aristocrats, you
do not even know how to swear. Your ancestors knew how!
They were fighters; they knew how to swear because they knew
how to attack; you poor moderns have no profanity left in you,
because, poisoned by idleness, you have forgotten even how to
resist. And yet you thought yourselves on top, and so you were&mdash;but
as foam is on top of the wave. You forgot that power,
like genius, always comes from underneath, because it is produced
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page029" name="page029"></a>(p. 029)</span> only by turmoil. We have had to wring the neck of
your feather-head court, because while the court was the nation
the nation had its pockets picked. You were at the mercy of
anybody with a pinch of brains: adventurers like Mazarin, like
Fouquet, like Law, or that little commoner, the woman Fish,
who called herself Pompadour and took France&mdash;France,
merely!&mdash;from your King, and used it to her own pleasure.
Then, at last, after the swindlers had well plucked you&mdash;at
last, unfortunate creatures, the People got you! Citizeness, the
People had starved: be assured they will eat you to the bone&mdash;and
then eat the bone! You are helpless because you have
learned nothing and forgotten everything. You have forgotten
everything in this world except how to be fat!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dossonville</span> [<i>applauding with unction</i>]. Beautiful! It is
beautiful, all that! A beautiful speech!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> Ass!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dossonville</span> [<i>meekly</i>]. Perfectly, perfectly.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>crossly</i>]. That wasn't a speech; it was the truth.
Citizeness Laseyne, so far as you are concerned, I am the People.
[<i>He extends his hand negligently, with open palm.</i>] And
I have got you. [<i>He clenches his fingers, like a cook's on the
neck of a fowl.</i>] Like that! And I'm going to take you back
to Paris, you and the Emigrant. [<i>She stands in an attitude
eloquent of despair. His glance roves from her to the door of
the other room, which is still slightly ajar; and, smiling at some
fugitive thought, he continues, deliberately.</i>] I take you: you
and your brother&mdash;and that rather pretty little person who
traveled with you. [<i>There is a breathless exclamation from
the other side of the door, which is flung open violently, as</i>
<span class="smcap">Eloise</span>&mdash;<i>flushed, radiant with anger, and altogether magnificent&mdash;sweeps
into the room to confront</i> <span class="smcap">Valsin</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>slamming the door behind her</i>]. Leave this Jack-in-Office
to me, Anne!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dossonville</span> [<i>dazed by the vision</i>]. Lord! What glory!
[<i>He rises, bowing profoundly, muttering hoarsely.</i>] Oh, eyes!
Oh, hair! Look at her shape! Her chin! The divine&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>getting up and patting him reassuringly on the
back</i>]. The lady perceives her effect, my Dossonville. It is no
novelty. Sit down, my Dossonville. [<i>The still murmurous</i>
<span class="smcap">Dossonville</span> <i>obeys</i> <span class="smcap">Valsin</span> <i>turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Eloise</span>, <i>a brilliant light
in his eyes.</i>] Let me greet one of the nieces of Widow Balsage&mdash;evidently
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page030" name="page030"></a>(p. 030)</span> not the sleepy one, and certainly not ill. Health
so transcendent&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>placing her hand upon</i> <span class="smcap">Madame de Laseyne's</span>
<i>shoulder</i>]. This is a clown, Anne. You need have no fear of
him whatever. His petty authority does not extend to us.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>deferentially</i>]. Will the niece of Widow Balsage
explain why it does not?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>turning upon him fiercely</i>]. Because the patriot
Citizeness Eloise d'Anville is here!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>assuming an air of thoughtfulness</i>]. Yes, she is
here. That "permit" yonder even mentions her by name. It
is curious. I shall have to go into that. Continue, niece.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>with supreme haughtiness</i>]. This lady is under her
protection.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>growing red</i>]. Pardon. Under whose protection?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>sulphurously</i>]. Under the protection of Eloise
d'Anville! [<i>This has a frightful effect upon</i> <span class="smcap">Valsin</span>; <i>his face
becomes contorted; he clutches at his throat, apparently half
strangled, staggers, and falls choking into the easy-chair he has
formerly occupied.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>gasping, coughing, incoherent</i>]. Under the pro&mdash;the
protection&mdash;[<i>He explodes into peal after peal of uproarious
laughter.</i>] The protection of&mdash;Aha, ha, ha, ho, ho,
ho! [<i>He rocks himself back and forth unappeasably.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>with a slight lift of the eyebrows</i>]. This man is
an idiot.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>during an abatement of his attack</i>]. Oh, pardon!
It is&mdash;too&mdash;much&mdash;too much for me! You say&mdash;these people
are&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>stamping her foot</i>]. Under the protection of Eloise
d'Anville, imbecile! You cannot touch them. She wills it!
[<i>At this,</i> <span class="smcap">Valsin</span> <i>shouts as if pleading for mercy, and beats the
air with his hands. He struggles to his feet and, pounding himself
upon the chest, walks to and fro in the effort to control
his convulsion.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Anne</span>, <i>under cover of the noise he makes</i>]. I
was wrong: he is not an idiot.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>despairingly</i>]. He laughs at you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>in a quick whisper</i>]. Out of bluster; because he is
afraid. He is badly frightened. I know just what to do. Go
into the other room with Louis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page031" name="page031"></a>(p. 031)</span> <span class="speaker">Anne</span> [<i>protesting weakly</i>]. I can't hope&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>flashing from a cloud</i>]. You failed, didn't you?
[<span class="smcap">Madame de Laseyne</span>, <i>after a tearful perusal of the stern resourcefulness
now written in the younger woman's eyes, succumbs
with a piteous gesture of assent and goes out forlornly.</i>
<span class="smcap">Eloise</span> <i>closes the door and stands with her back to it.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>paying no attention to them</i>]. Eloise d'Anville!
[<i>Still pacing the room in the struggle to subdue his hilarity.</i>]
This young citizeness speaks of the protection of Eloise
d'Anville! [<i>Leaning feebly upon</i> <span class="smcap">Dossonville's</span> <i>shoulder.</i>]
Do you hear, my Dossonville? It is an ecstasy. Ecstasize,
then. Scream, Dossonville!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dossonville</span> [<i>puzzled, but evidently accustomed to being
so, cackles instantly</i>]. Perfectly. Ha, ha! The citizeness is
not only stirringly beautiful, she is also&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> She is also a wit. Susceptible henchman, concentrate
your thoughts upon domesticity. In this presence remember
your wife!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>peremptorily</i>]. Dismiss that person. I have something
to say to you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>wiping his eyes</i>]. Dossonville, you are not required.
We are going to be sentimental, and heaven knows you are not
the moon. In fact, you are a fat old man. Exit, obesity! Go
somewhere and think about your children. Flit, whale!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dossonville</span> [<i>rising</i>]. Perfectly, my chieftain. [<i>He goes
to the broken door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>tapping the floor with her shoe</i>]. Out of hearing!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> The floor below.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dossonville.</span> Well understood. Perfectly, perfectly! [<i>He
goes out through the hallway; disappears, chuckling grossly.
There are some moments of silence within the room, while he
is heard clumping down a flight of stairs; then</i> <span class="smcap">Valsin</span> <i>turns
to</i> <span class="smcap">Eloise</span> <i>with burlesque ardor.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> "Alone at last!"</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>maintaining her composure</i>]. Rabbit!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>dropping into the chair at the desk, with mock dejection</i>].
Repulsed at the outset! Ah, Citizeness, there were
moments on the journey from Paris when I thought I
detected a certain kindness in your glances at the lonely
stranger.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>folding her arms</i>]. You are to withdraw your soldiers,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page032" name="page032"></a>(p. 032)</span> countersign the "permit," and allow my friends to embark
at once.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>with solemnity</i>]. Do you give it as an order,
Citizeness?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise.</span> I do. You will receive suitable political advancement.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>in a choked voice</i>]. You mean as a&mdash;a reward?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>haughtily</i>]. <i>I</i> guarantee that you shall receive it!
[<i>He looks at her strangely; then, with a low moan, presses his
hand to his side, seeming upon the point of a dangerous seizure.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>managing to speak</i>]. I can only beg you to spare
me. You have me at your mercy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>swelling</i>]. It is well for you that you understand
that!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>shaking his hand ruefully</i>]. Yes; you see I have a
bad liver: it may become permanently enlarged. Laughter is
my great danger.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>crying out with rage</i>]. <i>Oh!</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>dolorously</i>]. I have continually to remind myself
that I am no longer in the first flush of youth.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise.</span> Idiot! Do you not know who I am!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> You? Oh yes&mdash;[<i>He checks himself abruptly;
looks at her with brief intensity; turns his eyes away, half
closing them in quick meditation; smiles, as upon some secret
pleasantry, and proceeds briskly.</i>] Oh yes, yes, I know who
you are.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>beginning haughtily</i>]. Then you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>at once cutting her off</i>]. As to your name, I do
not say. Names at best are details; and your own is a detail
that could hardly be thought to matter. <i>What</i> you are is
obvious: you joined Louis and his sister in Paris at the barriers,
and traveled with them as "Marie Balsage," a sister.
You might save us a little trouble by giving us your real name;
you will probably refuse, and the police will have to look it up
when I take you back to Paris. Frankly, you are of no importance
to us, though of course we'll send you to the Tribunal.
No doubt you are a poor relative of the Valny-Cheraults, or,
perhaps, you may have been a governess in the Laseyne
family, or&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>under her breath</i>]. Idiot! Idiot!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>with subterranean enjoyment, watching her sidelong</i>].
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page033" name="page033"></a>(p. 033)</span> Or the good-looking wife of some faithful retainer of
the Emigrant's, perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>with a shrill laugh</i>]. Does the Committee of Public
Safety betray the same intelligence in the appointment of all
its agents? [<i>Violently.</i>] Imbecile, I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>quickly raising his voice to check her</i>]. You are
of no importance, I tell you! [<i>Changing his tone.</i>] Of course
I mean politically. [<i>With broad gallantry.</i>] Otherwise, I am
the first to admit extreme susceptibility. I saw that you observed
it on the way&mdash;at the taverns, in the diligence, at the
posting-houses, at&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>with serenity</i>]. Yes. I am accustomed to oglers.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> Alas, I believe you! My unfortunate sex is but
too responsive.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>gasping</i>]. "Responsive"&mdash;Oh!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>indulgently</i>]. Let us return to the safer subject.
Presently I shall arrest those people in the other room and,
regretfully, you too. But first I pamper myself; I chat; I have
an attractive woman to listen. In the matter of the arrest, I
delay my fire; I do not flash in the pan, but I lengthen my fuse.
Why? For the same reason that when I was a little boy and
had something good to eat, I always first paid it the compliments
of an epicure. I looked at it a long while. I played
with it. Then&mdash;I devoured it! I am still like that. And
Louis yonder is good to eat, because I happen not to love him.
However, I should mention that I doubt if he could recall
either myself or the circumstance which annoyed me; some episodes
are sometimes so little to certain people and so significant
to certain other people. [<i>He smiles, stretching himself luxuriously
in his chair.</i>] Behold me, Citizeness! I am explained.
I am indulging my humor: I play with my cake. Let us see
into what curious little figures I can twist it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise.</span> Idiot!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>pleasantly</i>]. I have lost count, but I think that is
the sixth idiot you have called me. Aha, it is only history,
which one admires for repeating itself. Good! Let us march.
I shall play&mdash;[<i>He picks up the "permit" from the desk,
studies it absently, and looks whimsically at her over his
shoulder, continuing:</i>] I shall play with&mdash;with all four of
you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>impulsively</i>]. Four?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page034" name="page034"></a>(p. 034)</span> <span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> I am not easy to deceive; there are four of you
here.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>staring</i>]. So?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> Louis brought you and his sister from Paris: a
party of three. This "permit" which he forged is for four;
the original three and the woman you mentioned a while ago,
Eloise d'Anville. Hence she must have joined you here. The
deduction is plain: there are three people in that room: the
Emigrant, his sister, and this Eloise d'Anville. To the trained
mind such reasoning is simple.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>elated</i>]. Perfectly!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>with an air of cunning</i>]. Nothing escapes me.
You see that.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise.</span> At first glance! I make you my most profound
compliments. Sir, you are an eagle!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>smugly</i>]. Thanks. Now, then, pretty governess,
you thought this d'Anville might be able to help you. What
put that in your head?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>with severity</i>]. Do you pretend not to know what
she is?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> A heroine I have had the misfortune never to encounter.
But I am informed of her character and history.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>sternly</i>]. Then you understand that even the Agent
of the National Committee risks his head if he dares touch
people she chooses to protect.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>extending his hand in plaintive appeal</i>]. Be generous
to my opacity. How could <i>she</i> protect anybody?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>with condescension</i>]. She has earned the gratitude&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> Of whom?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>superbly</i>]. Of the Nation!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>breaking out again</i>]. Ha, ha, ha! [<i>Clutching at
his side.</i>] Pardon, oh, pardon, liver of mine. I must not die;
my life is still useful.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>persisting stormily</i>]. Of the People, stupidity! Of
the whole People, dolt! Of France, blockhead!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>with a violent effort, conquering his hilarity</i>].
There! I am saved. Let us be solemn, my child; it is better
for my malady. You are still so young that one can instruct
you that individuals are rarely grateful; "the People," never.
What you call "the People" means folk who are not always
sure of their next meal; therefore their great political and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page035" name="page035"></a>(p. 035)</span> patriotic question is the cost of food. Their heroes are the
champions who are going to make it cheaper; and when these
champions fail them or cease to be useful to them, then they
either forget these poor champions&mdash;or eat them. Let us hear
what your Eloise d'Anville has done to earn the reward of
being forgotten instead of eaten.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>her lips quivering</i>]. She surrendered her property
voluntarily. She gave up all she owned to the Nation.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>genially</i>]. And immediately went to live with her
relatives in great luxury.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>choking</i>]. The Republic will protect her. She gave
her whole estate&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> And the order for its confiscation was already
written when she did it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>passionately</i>]. Ah&mdash;<i>liar!</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. I have seen the order. [<i>She leans against
the wall, breathing heavily. He goes on, smoothly.</i>] Yes, this
martyr "gave" us her property; but one hears that she went
to the opera just the same and wore more jewels than ever, and
lived richly upon the Laseynes and Valny-Cheraults, until <i>they</i>
were confiscated. Why, all the world knows about this woman;
and let me tell you, to your credit, my governess, I think you
have a charitable heart: you are the only person I ever heard
speak kindly of her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>setting her teeth</i>]. Venom!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>observing her slyly</i>]. It is with difficulty I am restraining
my curiosity to see her&mdash;also to hear her!&mdash;when she
learns of her proscription by a grateful Republic.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>with shrill mockery</i>]. Proscribed? Eloise d'Anville
proscribed? Your inventions should be more plausible, Goodman
Spy! I <i>knew</i> you were lying&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. You do not believe&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>proudly</i>]. Eloise d'Anville is a known Girondist.
The Gironde is the real power in France.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>mildly</i>]. That party has fallen.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>with fire</i>]. Not far! It will revive.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> Pardon, Citizeness, but you are behind the times,
and they are very fast nowadays&mdash;the times. The Gironde is
dead.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>ominously</i>]. It may survive <i>you</i>, my friend. Take
care!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page036" name="page036"></a>(p. 036)</span> <span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>unimpressed</i>]. The Gironde had a grand façade,
and that was all. It was a party composed of amateurs and
orators; and of course there were some noisy camp-followers
and a few comic-opera vivandières, such as this d'Anville. In
short, the Gironde looked enormous because it was hollow. It
was like a pie that is all crust. We have tapped the crust&mdash;with
a knife, Citizeness. There is nothing left.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>contemptuously</i>]. You say so. Nevertheless, the
Rolands&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>gravely</i>]. Roland was found in a field yesterday;
he had killed himself. His wife was guillotined the day after
you left Paris. Every one of their political friends is proscribed.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>shaking as with bitter cold</i>]. It is a lie! Not
Eloise d'Anville!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>rising</i>]. Would you like to see the warrant for
her arrest? [<i>He takes a packet of documents from his breast
pocket, selects one, and spreads it open before her.</i>] Let me
read you her description: "Eloise d'Anville, aristocrat. Figure,
comely. Complexion, blond. Eyes, dark blue. Nose, straight.
Mouth, wide&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>in a burst of passion, striking the warrant a violent
blow with her clenched fist</i>]. Let them dare! [<i>Beside herself,
she strikes again, tearing the paper from his grasp. She stamps
upon it.</i>] Let them dare, I say!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>picking up the warrant</i>]. Dare to say her mouth
is wide?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>cyclonic</i>]. Dare to arrest her!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> It does seem a pity. [<i>He folds the warrant slowly
and replaces it in his pocket.</i>] Yes, a great pity. She was the
one amusing thing in all this somberness. She will be missed.
The Revolution will lack its joke.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>recoiling, her passion exhausted</i>]. Ah, infamy!
[<i>She turns from him, covering her face with her hands.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>with a soothing gesture</i>]. Being only her friend,
you speak mildly. The d'Anville herself would call it blasphemy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>with difficulty</i>]. She is&mdash;so vain&mdash;then?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>lightly</i>]. Oh, a type&mdash;an actress.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>her back to him</i>]. How do you know? You said&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> That I had not encountered her. [<i>Glibly.</i>] One
knows best the people one has never seen. Intimacy confuses
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page037" name="page037"></a>(p. 037)</span> judgment. I confess to that amount of hatred for the former
Marquis de Valny-Cherault that I take as great an interest in
all that concerns him as if I loved him. And the little d'Anville
concerns him&mdash;yes, almost one would say, consumes him. The
unfortunate man is said to be so blindly faithful that he can
speak her name without laughing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>stunned</i>]. Oh!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>going on, cheerily</i>]. No one else can do that, Citizeness.
Jacobins, Cordeliers, Hébertists, even the shattered
relics of the Gironde itself, all alike join in the colossal laughter
at this Tricoteuse in Sèvres&mdash;this Jeanne d'Arc in rice-powder!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>tragically</i>]. They laugh&mdash;and proclaim her an
outlaw!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>waving his hand carelessly</i>]. Oh, it is only that
we are sweeping up the last remnants of aristocracy, and she
goes with the rest&mdash;into the dust-heap. She should have remained
a royalist; the final spectacle might have had dignity.
As it is, she is not of her own class, not of ours: neither fish
nor flesh nor&mdash;but yes, perhaps, after all, she is a fowl.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>brokenly</i>]. Alas! Homing&mdash;with wounded wing!
[<i>She sinks into a chair with pathetic grace, her face in her
hands.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>surreptitiously grinning</i>]. Not at all what I meant.
[<i>Brutally.</i>] Peacocks don't fly.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>regaining her feet at a bound</i>]. You imitation
dandy! You&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>with benevolence</i>]. My dear, your indignation for
your friend is chivalrous. It is admirable; but she is not worth
it. You do not understand her: you have probably seen her
so much that you have never seen her as she is.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>witheringly</i>]. But you, august Zeus, having <i>never</i>
seen her, will reveal her to me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>smoothly urbane</i>]. If you have ears. You see, she
is not altogether unique, but of a variety known to men who
are wise enough to make a study of women.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>snapping out a short, loud laugh in his face</i>].
Pouff!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>unruffled</i>]. I profess myself an apprentice. The
science itself is but in its infancy. Women themselves understand
very well that they are to be classified, and they fear that
we shall perceive it: they do not really wish to be known. Yet
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page038" name="page038"></a>(p. 038)</span> it is coming; some day our cyclopedists will have you sorted,
classed, and defined with precision; but the d'Alembert of the
future will not be a woman, because no woman so disloyal will
ever be found. Men have to acquire loyalty to their sex: yours
is an instinct. Citizen governess, I will give you a reading
of the little d'Anville from this unwritten work. To begin&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>feverishly interested, but affecting languor</i>]. <i>Must</i>
you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span>. To Eloise d'Anville the most interesting thing
about a rose-bush has always been that Eloise d'Anville could
smell it. Moonlight becomes important when it falls upon her
face; sunset is worthy when she grows rosy in it. To her mind,
the universe was set in motion to be the background for a
decoration, and she is the decoration. She believes that the
cathedral was built for the fresco. And when a dog interests
her, it is because he would look well beside her in a painting.
Such dogs have no minds. I refer you to all the dogs in the
portraits of Beauties.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>not at all displeased; pretending carelessness</i>]. Ah,
you have heard that she is beautiful?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span>. Far worse: that she is a Beauty. Let nothing ever
tempt <i>you</i>, my dear, into setting up in that line. For you are
very well-appearing, I assure you; and if you had been surrounded
with all the disadvantages of the d'Anville, who knows
but that you might have become as famous a Beauty as she?
What makes a Beauty is not the sumptuous sculpture alone, but
a very peculiar arrogance&mdash;not in the least arrogance of mind,
my little governess. In this, your d'Anville emerged from
childhood full-panoplied indeed; and the feather-head court fell
headlong at her feet. It was the fated creature's ruin.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>placidly</i>]. And it is because of her beauty that you
drag her to the guillotine?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span>. Bless you, I merely convey her!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span>. Tell me, logician, was it not her beauty that inspired
her to give her property to the Nation?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span>. It was.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span>. What perception! I am faint with admiration.
And no doubt it was her beauty that made her a Republican?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span>. What else?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span>. Hail, oracle! [<i>She releases an arpeggio of satiric
laughter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page039" name="page039"></a>(p. 039)</span> <span class="speaker">Valsin</span>. That laugh is diaphanous. I see you through it,
already convinced. [<i>She stops laughing immediately.</i>] Ha!
we may proceed. Remark this, governess: a Beauty is the living
evidence of man's immortality; the one plain proof that he has
a soul.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span>. It is not so bad then, after all?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span>. It is utterly bad. But of all people a Beauty is
most conscious of her duality. Her whole life is based upon
her absolute knowledge that her Self and her body are two.
She sacrifices all things to her beauty because her beauty feeds
her Self with a dreadful food which it has made her unable to
live without.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span>. My little gentleman, you talk like a sentimental
waiter. Your metaphors are all hot from the kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>nettled</i>]. It is natural; unlike your Eloise, I am
<i>really</i> of "the People"&mdash;and starved much in my youth.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span>. But, like her, you are still hungry.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span>. A Beauty is a species of cannibal priestess, my dear.
She will make burnt-offerings of her father and her mother,
her sisters&mdash;her lovers&mdash;to her beauty, that it may in turn
bring her the food she must have or perish.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span>. <i>Boum!</i> [<i>She snaps her fingers.</i>] And of course
she bathes in the blood of little children?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>grimly</i>]. Often.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>averting her gaze from his</i>]. This mysterious food&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span>. Not at all mysterious. Sensation. There you have
it. And that is why Eloise d'Anville is a renegade. You understand
perfectly.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span>. You are too polite. No.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>gaily</i>]. Behold, then! Many women who are not
Beauties are beautiful, but in such women you do not always
discover beauty at your first glance: it is disclosed with a subtle
tardiness. It does not dazzle; it is reluctant; but it grows as
you look again and again. You get a little here, a little there,
like glimpses of children hiding in a garden. It is shy, and
sometimes closed in from you altogether, and then, unexpectedly,
this belated loveliness springs into bloom before your very
eyes. It retains the capacity of surprise, the vital element of
charm. But the Beauty lays all waste before her at a stroke:
it is soon over. Thus your Eloise, brought to court, startled
Versailles; the sensation was overwhelming. Then Versailles
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page040" name="page040"></a>(p. 040)</span> got used to her, just as it had to its other prodigies: the fountains
were there, the King was there, the d'Anville was there;
and naturally, one had seen them; saw them every day&mdash;one
talked of matters less accepted. That was horrible to Eloise.
She had tasted; the appetite, once stirred, was insatiable. At
any cost she must henceforth have always the sensation of being
a sensation. She must be the pivot of a reeling world. So she
went into politics. Ah, Citizeness, there was one man who
understood Beauties&mdash;not Homer, who wrote of Helen! Romance
is gallant by profession, and Homer lied like a poet.
For the truth about the Trojan War is that the wise Ulysses
made it, not because Paris stole Helen, but because the Trojans
were threatening to bring her back.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>unwarily</i>]. Who was the man that understood
Beauties?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span>. Bluebeard. [<i>He crosses the room to the dressing-table,
leans his back against it in an easy attitude, his elbows
resting upon the top.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>slowly, a little tremulously</i>]. And so Eloise
d'Anville should have her head cut off?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span>. Well, she thought she was in politics, didn't she?
[<i>Suavely.</i>] You may be sure she thoroughly enjoyed her hallucination
that she was a great figure in the Revolution&mdash;which
was cutting off the heads of so many of her relatives and old
friends! Don't waste your pity, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>looking at him fixedly</i>]. Citizen, you must have
thought a great deal about my unhappy friend. She might be
flattered by so searching an interest.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>negligently</i>]. Not interest in her, governess, but
in the Emigrant who cools his heels on the other side of that
door, greatly to my enjoyment, waiting my pleasure to arrest
him. The poor wretch is the one remaining lover of this girl;
faithful because he let his passion for her become a habit; and
he will never get over it until he has had possession. She has
made him suffer frightfully, but I shall never forgive her for
not having dealt him the final stroke. It would have saved me
all the bother I have been put to in avenging the injury he
did me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>frowning</i>]. What "final stroke" could she have
"dealt" him?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>with sudden vehement intensity</i>]. She could have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page041" name="page041"></a>(p. 041)</span> loved him! [<i>He strikes the table with his fist.</i>] I see it! I
see it! Beauty's husband! [<i>Pounding the table with each
exclamation, his voice rising in excitement.</i>] What a vision!
This damned, proud, loving Louis, a pomade bearer! A buttoner!
An errand-boy to the perfumer's, to the chemist's, to
the milliner's! A groom of the powder-closet&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>snatching at the opportunity</i>]. How noisy you are!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>discomfited, apologetically</i>]. You see, it is only so
lately that we of "the People" have dared even to whisper.
Of course, now that we are free to shout, we overdo it. We
let our voices out, we let our joys out, we let our hates out.
We let everything out&mdash;except our prisoners! [<i>He smiles winningly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>slowly</i>]. Do you guess what all this bluster&mdash;this
tirade upon the wickedness of beauty&mdash;makes me think?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span>. Certainly. Being a woman, you cannot imagine a
bitterness which is not "personal."</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>laughing</i>]. "Being a woman," I think that the
person who has caused you the greatest suffering in your life
must be very good-looking!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>calmly</i>]. Quite right. It was precisely this
d'Anville. I will tell you. [<i>He sits on the arm of a chair
near her, and continues briskly.</i>] I was not always a politician.
Six years ago I was a soldier in the Valny regiment of cavalry.
That was the old army, that droll army, that royal army; so
ridiculous that it was truly majestic. In the Valny regiment
we had some rouge-pots for officers&mdash;and for a colonel, who
but our Emigrant yonder! Aha! we suffered in the ranks, let
me tell you, when Eloise had been coy; and one morning it
was my turn. You may have heard that she was betrothed first
to Louis and later to several others? My martyrdom occurred
the day after she had announced to the court her betrothal to
the young Duc de Creil, whose father afterward interfered.
Louis put us on drill in a hard rain: he had the habit of relieving
his chagrin like that. My horse fell, and happened to
shower our commander with mud. Louis let out all his rage
upon me: it was an excuse, and, naturally, he disliked mud.
But I was rolling in it, with my horse: I also disliked it&mdash;and
I was indiscreet enough to attempt some small reply. That
finished my soldiering, Citizeness. He had me tied to a post
before the barracks for the rest of the day. I remember with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page042" name="page042"></a>(p. 042)</span> remarkable distinctness that the valets of heaven had neglected
to warm the rain for that bath; that it was February; and that
Louis's orders had left me nothing to wear upon my back except
an unfulsome descriptive placard and my modesty. Altogether
it was a disadvantageous position, particularly for the exchange
of repartee with such of my comrades as my youthful amiability
had not endeared; I have seldom seen more cheerful indifference
to bad weather. Inclement skies failed to injure the spectacle:
it was truly the great performance of my career; some
people would not even go home to eat, and peddlers did a good
trade in cakes and wine. In the evening they whipped me conscientiously&mdash;my
tailor has never since made me an entirely
comfortable coat. Then they gave me the place of honor at
the head of a procession by torchlight and drummed me out of
camp with my placard upon my back. So I adopted another
profession: I had a friend who was a doctor in the stables of
d'Artois; and I knew horses. He made me his assistant.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>shuddering</i>]. You are a veterinarian!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. No; a horse-doctor. It was thus I "retired"
from the army and became a politician. My friend was
only a horse-doctor himself, but his name happened to be Marat.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span>. Ah, frightful! [<i>For the first time she begins to
feel genuine alarm.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span>. The sequence is simple. If Eloise d'Anville hadn't
coquetted with young Creil I shouldn't be Commissioner here
to-day, settling my account with Louis. I am in his debt for
more than the beating: I should tell you there was a woman
in my case, a slender lace-maker with dark eyes&mdash;very pretty
eyes. She had furnished me with a rival, a corporal; and he
brought her for a stroll in the rain past our barracks that day
when I was attracting so much unsought attention. They
waited for the afterpiece, enjoyed a pasty and a bottle of
Beaune, and went away laughing cozily together. I did not
see my pretty lace-maker again, not for years&mdash;not until a
month ago. Her corporal was still with her, and it was their
turn to be undesirably conspicuous. They were part of a procession
passing along the Rue St. Honoré on its way to the
Place of the Revolution. They were standing up in the cart;
the lace-maker had grown fat, and she was scolding her poor
corporal bitterly. What a habit that must have been!&mdash;they
were not five minutes from the guillotine. I own that a thrill
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page043" name="page043"></a>(p. 043)</span> of gratitude to Louis temporarily softened me toward him,
though at the very moment I was following him through the
crowd. At least he saved me from the lace-maker!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>shrinking from him</i>]. You are horrible!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span>. To my regret you must find me more and
more so.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>panting</i>]. You <i>are</i> going to take us back to Paris,
then? To the Tribunal&mdash;and to the&mdash;[<i>She covers her eyes
with her hands.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>gravely</i>]. I can give you no comfort, governess.
You are involved with the Emigrant, and, to be frank, I am
going to do as horrible things to Louis as I can invent&mdash;and
I am an ingenious man. [<i>His manner becomes sinister.</i>] I
am near the top. The cinders of Marat are in the Pantheon,
but Robespierre still flames; and he claims me as his friend.
I can do what I will. And I have much in store for Louis
before he shall be so fortunate as to die!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>faintly</i>]. And&mdash;and Eloise&mdash;d'Anville? [<i>Her
hands fall from her face: he sees large, beautiful tears upon
her cheeks.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>coldly</i>]. Yes. [<i>She is crushed for the moment;
then, recovering herself with a violent effort, lifts her head defiantly
and stands erect, facing him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span>. You take her head because your officer punished
you, six years ago, for a breach of military discipline!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>in a lighter tone</i>]. Oh no. I take it, just as she
injured me&mdash;incidentally. In truth, Citizeness, it isn't I who
take it: I only arrest her because the government has proscribed
her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span>. And you've just finished telling me you were preparing
tortures for her! I thought you an intelligent man.
Pah! You're only a gymnast. [<i>She turns away from him
haughtily and moves toward the door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>touching his scarf of office</i>]. True. I climb. [<i>She
halts suddenly, as if startled by this; she stands as she is, her
back to him, for several moments, and does not change her attitude
when she speaks.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>slowly</i>]. You climb alone.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>with a suspicious glance at her</i>]. Yes&mdash;alone.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>in a low voice</i>]. Why didn't you take the lace-maker
with you? You might have been happier. [<i>Very slowly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page044" name="page044"></a>(p. 044)</span> she turns and comes toward him, her eyes full upon his: she
moves deliberately and with incomparable grace. He seems to
be making an effort to look away, and failing: he cannot release
his eyes from the glorious and starry glamour that holds them.
She comes very close to him, so close that she almost touches
him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>in a half-whisper</i>]. You might have been happier
with&mdash;a friend&mdash;to climb with you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>demoralized</i>]. Citizeness&mdash;I am&mdash;I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>in a voice of velvet</i>]. Yes, Say it. You are&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>desperately</i>]. I have told you that I am the most
susceptible of men.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>impulsively putting her hand on his shoulder</i>]. Is
it a crime? Come, my friend, you are a man who <i>does</i> climb:
you will go over all. You believe in the Revolution because
you have used it to lift you. But other things can help you,
too. Don't you need them?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>understanding perfectly, gasping</i>]. Need what?
[<i>She draws her hand from his shoulder, moves back from him
slightly, and crosses her arms upon her bosom with a royal
meekness.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>grandly</i>]. Do I seem so useless?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>in a distracted voice</i>]. Heaven help me! What
do you want?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise.</span> Let these people go. [<i>Hurriedly, leaning near
him.</i>] I have promised to save them: give them their permit
to embark, and I&mdash;[<i>She pauses, flushing beautifully, but does
not take her eyes from him.</i>] I&mdash;I do not wish to leave France.
My place is in Paris. You will go into the National Committee.
You can be its ruler. You <i>will</i> rule it! I believe in
you! [<i>Glowing like a rose of fire.</i>] I will go with you. I
will help you! I will marry you!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>in a fascinated whisper</i>]. Good Lord! [<i>He stumbles
back from her, a strange light in his eyes.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span>. You are afraid&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>with sudden loudness</i>]. I am! Upon my soul, I
am afraid!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>smiling gloriously upon him</i>]. Of what, my friend?
Tell me of what?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>explosively</i>]. Of myself! I am afraid of myself
because I am a prophet. This is precisely what I foretold to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page045" name="page045"></a>(p. 045)</span> myself you would do! I knew it, yet I am aghast when it
happens&mdash;aghast at my own cleverness!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>bewildered to blankness</i>]. What?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>half hysterical with outrageous vanity</i>]. I swear
I knew it, and it fits so exactly that I am afraid of myself!
<i>Aha</i>, Valsin, you rogue! I should hate to have you on <i>my</i>
track! Citizen governess, you are a wonderful person, but not
so wonderful as this devil of a Valsin!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>vaguely, in a dead voice</i>]. I cannot understand
what you are talking about. Do you mean&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> And what a spell was upon me! I was near calling
Dossonville to preserve me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>speaking with a strange naturalness, like a child's</i>].
You mean&mdash;you don't want me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> Ah, Heaven help me, I am going to laugh again!
Oh, ho, ho! I am spent! [<i>He drops into a chair and gives
way to another attack of uproarious hilarity.</i>] Ah, ha, ha, ha!
Oh, my liver, ha, ha! No, Citizeness, I do not want you!
Oh, ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise.</span> <i>Oh!</i> [<i>She utters a choked scream and rushes at
him.</i>] Swine!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>warding her off with outstretched hands</i>]. Spare
me! Ha, ha, ha! I am helpless! Ho, ho, ho! Citizeness, it
would not be worth your while to strangle a man who is already
dying!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>beside herself</i>]. Do you dream that I <i>meant</i> it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>feebly</i>]. Meant to strangle me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>frantic</i>]. To give myself to you!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span>. In short, to&mdash;to marry me! [<i>He splutters.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>furiously</i>]. It was a ruse&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>soothingly</i>]. Yes, yes, a trick. I saw that all along.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>even more infuriated</i>]. For their sake, beast! [<i>She
points to the other room.</i>] To save <i>them</i>!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>wiping his eyes</i>]. Of course, of course. [<i>He rises,
stepping quickly to the side of the chair away from her and
watching her warily.</i>] <i>I</i> knew it was to save them. We'll put
it like that.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise</span> [<i>in an anger of exasperation</i>]. It <i>was</i> that!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span>. Yes, yes. [<i>Keeping his distance.</i>] I saw it from
the first. [<i>Suppressing symptoms of returning mirth.</i>] It was
perfectly plain. You mustn't excite yourself&mdash;nothing could
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page046" name="page046"></a>(p. 046)</span> have been clearer! [<i>A giggle escapes him, and he steps hastily
backward as she advances upon him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eloise.</span> Poodle! Valet! Scum of the alleys! Sheep of the
prisons! Jailer! Hangman! Assassin! Brigand! <i>Horse-doctor!</i>
[<i>She hurls the final epithet at him in a climax of
ferocity which wholly exhausts her; and she sinks into the chair
by the desk, with her arms upon the desk and her burning face
hidden in her arms.</i> <span class="smcap">Valsin</span>, <i>morbidly chuckling, in spite of
himself, at each of her insults, has retreated farther and farther,
until he stands with his back against the door of the inner room,
his right hand behind him, resting on the latch. As her furious
eyes leave him he silently opens the door, letting it remain a
few inches ajar and keeping his back to it. Then, satisfied that
what he intends to say will be overheard by those within, he
erases all expression from his face, and strides to the dismantled
doorway in the passage.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>calling loudly</i>]. Dossonville! [<i>He returns, coming
down briskly to</i> <span class="smcap">Eloise</span>. <i>His tone is crisp and soldier-like.</i>]
Citizeness, I have had my great hour. I proceed with the arrests.
I have given you four plenty of time to prepare yourselves.
Time? Why, the Emigrant could have changed clothes with
one of the women in there a dozen times if he had hoped to
escape in that fashion&mdash;as historical prisoners <i>have</i> won clear,
it is related. Fortunately, that is impossible just now; and he
will not dare to attempt it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dossonville</span> [<i>appearing in the hallway</i>]. Present, my
chieftain!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>sharply</i>]. Attend, Dossonville. The returned
Emigrant, Valny-Cherault, is forfeited; but because I cherish
a special grievance against him, I have decided upon a special
punishment for him. It does not please me that he should have
the comfort and ministrations of loving women on his journey
to the Tribunal. No, no; the presence of his old sweetheart
would make even the scaffold sweet to him. Therefore I shall
take him alone. I shall let these women go.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dossonville.</span> What refinement! Admirable! [<span class="smcap">Eloise</span>
<i>slowly rises, staring incredulously at</i> <span class="smcap">Valsin</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>picking up the "permit" from the desk</i>]. "Permit
the Citizen Balsage and his sister, the Citizeness Virginie
Balsage, and his second sister, Marie Balsage, and Eloise
d'Anville&mdash;" Ha! You see, Dossonville, since one of these
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page047" name="page047"></a>(p. 047)</span> three women is here, there are two in the other room with the
Emigrant. They are to come out, leaving him there. First,
however, we shall disarm him. You and I have had sufficient
experience in arresting aristocrats to know that they are not
always so sensible as to give themselves up peaceably, and I
happened to see the outline of a pistol under the Emigrant's
frock the other day in the diligence. We may as well save one
of us from a detestable hole through the body. [<i>He steps
toward the door, speaking sharply.</i>] Emigrant, you have
heard. For your greater chagrin, these three devoted women
are to desert you. Being an aristocrat, you will pretend to
prefer this arrangement. They are to leave at once. Throw
your pistol into this room, and I will agree not to make the
arrest until they are in safety. They can reach your vessel in
five minutes. When they have gone, I give you my word not
to open this door for ten. [<i>A pistol is immediately thrown
out of the door, and falls at</i> <span class="smcap">Valsin's</span> <i>feet. He picks it up, his
eyes alight with increasing excitement.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>tossing the pistol to</i> <span class="smcap">Dossonville</span>]. Call the lieutenant.
[<span class="smcap">Dossonville</span> <i>goes to the window, leans out, and
beckons.</i> <span class="smcap">Valsin</span> <i>writes hastily at the desk, not sitting down.</i>]
"Permit the three women Balsage to embark without delay
upon the <i>Jeune Pierrette</i>. Signed: Valsin." There, Citizeness,
is a "permit" which permits. [<i>He thrusts the paper into the
hand of</i> <span class="smcap">Eloise</span>, <i>swings toward the door of the inner room, and
raps loudly upon it.</i>] Come, my feminines! Your sailors await
you&mdash;brave, but no judges of millinery. There's a fair wind
for you; and a grand toilet is wasted at sea. Come, charmers;
come! [<i>The door is half opened, and</i> <span class="smcap">Madame de Laseyne</span>,
<i>white and trembling violently, enters quickly, shielding as much
as she can the inexpressibly awkward figure of her brother, behind
whom she extends her hand, closing the door sharply. He
wears the brocaded skirt which</i> <span class="smcap">Madame de Laseyne</span> <i>has
taken from the portmanteau, and</i> <span class="smcap">Eloise's</span> <i>long mantle, the
lifted hood and</i> <span class="smcap">Madame de Laseyne's</span> <i>veil shrouding his head
and face.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>in a stifled voice</i>]. At last! At last one beholds

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>shouting</i>]. It doesn't! [<i>He bows gallantly to</i>
<span class="smcap">Louis</span>.] A cruel veil, but, oh, what queenly grace! [<span class="smcap">Louis</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page048" name="page048"></a>(p. 048)</span> <i>stumbles in the skirt.</i> <span class="smcap">Valsin</span> <i>falls back, clutching at his side.
But</i> <span class="smcap">Eloise</span> <i>rushes to</i> <span class="smcap">Louis</span> <i>and throws herself upon her knees
at his feet. She pulls his head down to hers and kisses him
through the veil.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>madly</i>]. Oh, touching devotion! Oh, sisters! Oh,
love! Oh, honey! Oh, petticoats&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dossonville</span> [<i>interrupting humbly</i>]. The lieutenant, Citizen
Commissioner. [<i>He points to the hallway, where the
officer appears, standing at attention.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>wheeling</i>]. Officer, conduct these three persons to
the quay. Place them on board the <i>Jeune Pierrette</i>. The captain

shoulder at</i> <span class="smcap">Valsin</span> <i>as she disappears, and one word of concentrated
venom:</i> "Buffoon!" <i>In wild spirits he blows a kiss
to her. The fugitives are heard clattering madly down the
stairs.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dossonville</span> [<i>excitedly</i>]. We can take the Emigrant now.
[<i>Going to the inner door.</i>] Why wait&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin.</span> That room is empty.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dossonville.</span> What!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Valsin</span> [<i>shouting with laughter</i>]. He's gone! Not bare-backed,

<i>A DRAMATIC FANTASY IN ONE ACT</i><br>
<span class="smaller">By<br>
ERNEST DOWSON<br>
<i>Performance Free</i></span></h1>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page053" name="page053"></a>(p. 053)</span> Ernest Christopher Dowson, now generally known simply as
Ernest Dowson, was born at the Grove, Belmont Hill, Lee,
Kent, August 2, 1867, and died in London thirty-three years
later. His schooling, because of his delicate health, was irregular,
and he spent too short a time at Queen's College,
Oxford, to take a degree. He lived abroad much, but during
his sojourns in London in the 'nineties belonged to the Rhymer's
Club<a id="footnotetag26" name="footnotetag26"></a><a href="#footnote26" title="Go to footnote 26"><span class="smaller">[26]</span></a> that met in an upper room of Johnson's own "Cheshire
Cheese." His death from consumption brought to a close a life
marred by waste and sordid associations.</p>

<p><i>The Pierrot of the Minute</i>, Ernest Dowson's only dramatic
attempt, is touched like the preceding play with the glamour of
the old régime. Its charming artificiality suggests the pastoral
games to which the ladies and gentlemen of Louis XV's circle
may have turned for relief after the formalities and extravagances
of their life at court.</p>

<p>Dowson's play, written in 1892, is mentioned in one of his
letters, dated October twenty-fourth of that year: "I have been
frightfully busy," he wrote, "having rashly undertaken to make
a little Pierrot play in verse ... which is to be played at
Aldershot and afterwards at the Chelsea Town Hall: the
article to be delivered in a fortnight. So until this period of
mental agony is past, I can go nowhere." Anyone who has
ever had to write something that had to be ready on a certain
date will understand the quality of Dowson's emotion in this
letter.</p>

<p>A recent critic who has studied the literary fashions of the
group to which Dowson belonged and found that the members
were addicted to the frequent use of the adjective, white, says:
"Ernest Dowson was dominated by a sense of whiteness....
<i>The Pierrot of the Minute</i> is a veritable symphony in white.
He calls for 'white music' and the Moon Maiden rides through
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page054" name="page054"></a>(p. 054)</span> the skies 'drawn by a team of milk-white butterflies,' and farther
on in the same poem we have a palace of many rooms:</p>

<p class="poem10">
<span class="min06em">"'</span>Within the fairest, clad in purity,<br>
Our mother dwelt immemorially:<br>
Moon-calm, moon-pale, with moon-stones on her gown,<br>
The floor she treads with little pearls is sown....'"</p>

<p>When the play was given in this country at the McCallum
Theatre at Northampton, Massachusetts, it was "staged in
black and white, the garden set having black walls on which
fantastic white forms were stenciled. The bench, the statue,
and Pierrot and his lady love were in white. To have tried
to depict a real garden would have crowded the small stage,
so a garden was suggested, and by suggestion caught the spirit
of the piece."<a id="footnotetag27" name="footnotetag27"></a><a href="#footnote27" title="Go to footnote 27"><span class="smaller">[27]</span></a></p>

<p>Granville Bantock, the English musician, composed <i>The
Pierrot of the Minute</i>. <i>A Comedy Overture to a Dramatic
Phantasy by Ernest Dowson</i>, which he conducted at the
Worcester Festival in 1908. This music in whole or part may
be used in connection with a production of Dowson's play.</p>

My journey's end! This surely is the glade<br>
Which I was promised: I have well obeyed!<br>
A clue of lilies was I bid to find,<br>
Where the green alleys most obscurely wind;<br>
Where tall oaks darkliest canopy o'erhead,<br>
And moss and violet make the softest bed;<br>
Where the path ends, and leagues behind me lie<br>
The gleaming courts and gardens of Versailles;<br>
The lilies streamed before me, green and white;<br>
I gathered, following: they led me right,<br>
To the bright temple and the sacred grove:<br>
This is, in truth, the very shrine of Love!<br>
<span class="min1em">[<i>He gathers together his flowers and lays them at the foot
of Cupid's statue; then he goes timidly up the first steps
of the temple and stops.</i>]</span><br>
It is so solitary, I grow afraid.<br>
Is there no priest here, no devoted maid?<br>
Is there no oracle, no voice to speak,<br>
Interpreting to me the word I seek?<br>
<span class="min1em">[<i>A very gentle music of lutes floats out from the temple.</i>
<span class="smcap">Pierrot</span> <i>starts back; he shows extreme surprise; then he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page056" name="page056"></a>(p. 056)</span> returns to the foreground, and crouches down in rapt attention
until the music ceases. His face grows puzzled
and petulant.</i>]</span><br>
Too soon! too soon! in that enchanting strain,<br>
Days yet unlived, I almost lived again:<br>
It almost taught me that I most would know&mdash;<br>
Why am I here, and why am I Pierrot?<br>
<span class="min1em">[<i>Absently he picks up a lily which has fallen to the ground,
and repeats.</i>]</span><br>
Why came I here, and why am I Pierrot?<br>
That music and this silence both affright;<br>
Pierrot can never be a friend of night.<br>
I never felt my solitude before&mdash;<br>
Once safe at home, I will return no more.<br>
Yet the commandment of the scroll was plain;<br>
While the light lingers let me read again.<br>
<span class="min1em">[<i>He takes a scroll from his bosom and reads.</i>]</span><br>
"<i>He loves to-night who never loved before;<br>

Thus much is done, the night remains to me.<br>
Well, Cupidon, be my security!<br>

Society with such a friend as this.<br>
How merrily the rosy bubbles pass,<br>
Across the amber crystal of the glass.<br>
I had forgotten you. Methinks this quest<br>
Can wake no sweeter echo in my breast.<br>

Music, more music, far away and faint:<br>
It is an echo of mine heart's complaint.<br>
Why should I be so musical and sad?<br>
I wonder why I used to be so glad?<br>
In single glee I chased blue butterflies,<br>
Half butterfly myself, but not so wise,<br>
For they were twain, and I was only one.<br>
Ah me! how pitiful to be alone.<br>
My brown birds told me much, but in mine ear<br>
They never whispered this&mdash;I learned it here:<br>
The soft wood sounds, the rustlings in the breeze,<br>
Are but the stealthy kisses of the trees.<br>
Each flower and fern in this enchanted wood<br>
Leans to her fellow, and is understood;<br>
The eglantine, in loftier station set,<br>
Stoops down to woo the maidly violet.<br>
In gracile pairs the very lilies grow:<br>
None is companionless except Pierrot.<br>
Music, more music! how its echoes steal<br>
Upon my senses with unlooked for weal.<br>
Tired am I, tired, and far from this lone glade<br>
Seems mine old joy in rout and masquerade.<br>
Sleep cometh over me, now will I prove,<br>
By Cupid's grace, what is this thing called love.<br>

Unwitting boy! when, be it soon or late,<br>
What Pierrot ever has escaped his fate?<br>
What if I warned him! He might yet evade,<br>
Through the long windings of this verdant glade;<br>
Seek his companions in the blither way,<br>
Which, else, must be as lost as yesterday.<br>
So might he still pass some unheeding hours<br>
In the sweet company of birds and flowers.<br>
How fair he is, with red lips formed for joy,<br>
As softly curved as those of Venus' boy.<br>
Methinks his eyes, beneath their silver sheaves,<br>
Rest tranquilly like lilies under leaves.<br>
Arrayed in innocence, what touch of grace<br>
Reveals the scion of a courtly race?<br>
Well, I will warn him, though, I fear, too late&mdash;<br>
What Pierrot ever has escaped his fate?<br>

<p><i>The sun is up, yet ere a body stirs,<br>
A word with you, sweet ladies and dear sirs,<br>
(Although on no account let any say<br>
That</i> <span class="smcap">Pierrot</span> <i>finished Mr. Dowson's play</i>).</p>

<p><i>One night not long ago, at Baden Baden,&mdash;<br>
The birthday of the Duke,&mdash;his pleasure garden<br>
Was lighted gaily with</i> feu d'artifice,<br>
<i>With candles, rockets, and a center-piece<br>
Above the conversation house, on high,<br>
Outlined in living fire against the sky,<br>
A glittering</i> Pierrot, <i>radiant, white,<br>
Whose heart beat fast, who danced with sheer delight,<br>
Whose eyes were blue, whose lips were rosy red,<br>
Whose</i> pompons <i>too were fire, while on his head<br>
He wore a little cap, and I am told<br>
That rockets covered him with showers of gold.<br>

What with applause and gold, one must confess<br>
That</i> Pierrot <i>had "arrived," achieved success,<br>

A terrible disaster came to pass.<br>
His nose grew dim, the people gave a shout,<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page074" name="page074"></a>(p. 074)</span> His red lips paled, both his blue eyes went out.<br>
There rose a sullen sound of discontent,<br>
The golden shower of rockets was all spent;<br>
He left off dancing with a sudden jerk,<br>
For he was nothing but a firework.<br>
The garden darkened and the people in it<br>
Cried, "He is dead,&mdash;the</i> Pierrot <i>of the minute!"</i></p>

<p><i>With every artist it is even so;<br>
The artist, after all, is a</i> Pierrot&mdash;<br>
<i>A</i> Pierrot <i>of the minute, naif, clever,<br>

<p><i>Then pardon my Moon Maid and me, because<br>

<i>A FANTASY IN ONE ACT</i><br>
<span class="smaller">By<br>
OLIPHANT DOWN</span></h1>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page077" name="page077"></a>(p. 077)</span> <i>The Maker of Dreams</i> by the late Oliphant Down was first
given at the Royalty Theatre in Glasgow, November 20, 1911.
The design for the setting here reproduced was used when the
play was acted in March, 1915, at The Neighborhood Playhouse
in New York. The picture does not show how touches
of red here and there in the scene, and the brilliant blue sky,
visible through the quaint windows, enhanced the character of
the black and white of the walls and of the flower pots. The
back wall of the set was mounted on casters and, while
Pierrette slept, moved silently off stage, to disclose to the audience
a formal garden at the back, where a miniature Pierrot
and a tiny Pierrette did a joyous little dance, thus suggesting
to the spectators Pierrette's happy dream.</p>

<p>Pierrot, the hero of this and of the preceding play, has had
an interesting stage history. To understand him fully we have
to go back to the comedy of masks that had fully developed in
Italy by the time of the Renascence. This comedy was a special
kind of play, the scenario of which only was written, the dialogue
being improvised by the individual players. Each player
wore a costume and a mask that never changed, and these fixed
his identity. Most of the parts had a strong local flavor, the
pedant, for example, hailing from Bologna, the overly shrewd
merchant, from Venice. Many of the characters have become
fixed types and reappear under their old names in various forms
of modern drama. Pantaloon, Harlequin, Columbine, Punch
and Judy, and Pierrot are among those who live on in modern
drama. There is an enchanting play by Granville Barker and
Dion Clayton Calthrop called <i>The Harlequinade</i>, that describes
in a popular way the devious and uncertain paths traveled by
these stock characters down the ages.</p>

<p>Pierrot's ancestry is not so clearly Italian as the others.
Pedrolino, a mischievous, intriguing buffoon, Pagliaccio, a madcap
who wore a painted hat of white wool and a garment of
white linen, whose face was covered with flour, and who wore
a white mask, have both been cited as types that may have contributed
to the figure of Pierrot, whose name makes its first
appearance in Molière's play, <i>Don Juan ou le Festin de Pierre</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page078" name="page078"></a>(p. 078)</span> Not that this dull servant of Molière's is in any sense the
counterpart of the Pierrot of our day who is by turns languishing
or vivacious, impish or poetic, but never doltish. From the
seventeenth century, Pierrot, his costume borrowed from the
Neapolitan mask, Pulcinella, became more and more prominent
on both the Italian and the French stage. It was a certain
French pantomime actor by the name of Deburau who died a
few years before the middle of the nineteenth century, who
gave Pierrot the prominence that he enjoys to-day and who
dressed the character in the guise that he most often assumes
on the modern stage. "The short woolen tunic, with its great
buttons and its narrow sleeves, that overhung the hands, soon
became an ample calico blouse with wide long sleeves like those
of the Italian Pagliaccio. He suppressed the collar, which cast
an upward shadow from the footlights on to his face, and interfered
with the play of his countenance, and instead of the
white skull-cap of his predecessor, he emphasized the pallor of
his face by framing it in a cap of black velvet."<a id="footnotetag29" name="footnotetag29"></a><a href="#footnote29" title="Go to footnote 29"><span class="smaller">[29]</span></a> The Pierrot
of our fancy<a id="footnotetag30" name="footnotetag30"></a><a href="#footnote30" title="Go to footnote 30"><span class="smaller">[30]</span></a> comes to us also through the pictures of Watteau
and Pater and the designs of Aubrey Beardsley.</p>

<p>A one-act farce, <i>The Quod Wrangle</i>, is the only other published
play of Oliphant Down's. Its plot, as outlined in <i>The
London Times</i> of March 4, 1914, reminds one strongly of
O. Henry's <i>The Cop and the Anthem</i>.</p>

<p class="opening"><i><span class="min10pc">Evening. A room in an old cottage,</span> with walls of dark oak,
lit only by the moonlight that peers through the long, low
casement-window at the back, and the glow from the fire
that is burning merrily on the spectator's left. A cobbled
street can be seen outside, and a door to the right of the
window opens directly on to it. Opposite the fire is a
kitchen dresser with cups and plates twinkling in the firelight.
A high-backed oak settle, as though afraid of the
cold moonlight, has turned its back on the window and
warms its old timbers at the fire. In the middle of the
room stands a table with a red cover; there are chairs on
either side of it. On the hob, a kettle is keeping itself
warm; whilst overhead, on the hood of the chimney-piece,
a small lamp is turned very low.</i></p>

<p class="opening"><i><span class="min10pc">A figure flits past the window and,</span> with a click of the latch,</i>
<span class="smcap">Pierrette</span> <i>enters. She hangs up her cloak by the door,
gives a little shiver and runs to warm herself for a moment.
Then, having turned up the lamp, she places the
kettle on the fire. Crossing the room, she takes a tablecloth
from the dresser and proceeds to lay tea, setting out
crockery for two. Once she goes to the window and, drawing
aside the common red casement-curtains, looks out, but
returns to her work, disappointed. She puts a spoonful of
tea into the teapot, and another, and a third. Something
outside attracts her attention; she listens, her face brightening.
A voice is heard singing:</i></p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. How cold it was in the market-place to-day! I
don't believe I sang at all well. I can't sing in the cold.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. Ah, you're like the kettle. He can't sing when
he's cold either. Hurry up, Mr. Kettle, if you please.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span> [<i>looking into the fire</i>]. I wonder. She had beauty,
she had form, but had she soul?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span> [<i>cutting bread and butter at the table</i>]. Come
and be cheerful, instead of grumbling there to the fire.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. I was thinking.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. Come and have tea. When you sit by the fire,
thoughts only fly up the chimney.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. The whole world's a chimney-piece. Give people
a thing as worthless as paper, and it catches fire in them and
makes a stir; but real thought, they let it go up with the smoke.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. I try to be happy.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. Ugh! [<i>He has moved to the table. There is a
short silence, during which</i> <span class="smcap">Pierrot</span> <i>sips his tea moodily.</i>]</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. Tea all right?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. Middling.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. Only middling! I'll pour you out some fresh.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. Oh, it's all right! How you do worry a fellow!</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. Heigh-ho! Shall I chain up that big black dog?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. I say, did you see that girl to-day?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. Whereabouts?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. Standing by the horse-trough. With a fine air,
and a string of great beads.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. I didn't see her.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. I did, though. And she saw me. Watched me all
the time I was singing, and clapped her hands like anything
each time. I wonder if it is possible for a woman to have a
soul as well as such beautiful coloring.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. She was made up!</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. I'm sure she was not. And how do you know?
You didn't see her.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. Perhaps I <i>did</i> see her.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. Now, look here, Pierrette, it's no good your being
jealous. When you and I took on this show business, we arranged
to be just partners and nothing more. If I see anyone
I want to marry, I shall marry 'em. And if you see anyone
who wants to marry you, <i>you</i> can marry 'em.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. I'm not jealous! It's absurd!</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. Did you see that girl after the show?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. No. She had slipped away in the crowd. Here,
I've had enough tea. I shall go out and try to find her.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. Why don't you stay in by the fire? You could
help me to darn the socks.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page082" name="page082"></a>(p. 082)</span> <span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. Don't try to chaff me. Darning, indeed! I hope
life has got something better in it than darning.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. I doubt it. It's pretty much the same all the
world over. First we wear holes in our socks, and then we
mend them. The wise ones are those who make the best of it,
and darn as well as they can.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. I say, that gives me an idea for a song.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. Out with it, then.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. Well, I haven't exactly formed it yet. This is
what flashed through my mind as you spoke: [<i>He runs up on
to the table, using it as a stage.</i>]</p>

<p class="poem20">
"Life's a ball of worsted,<br>
<span class="add1em">Unwind it if you can,</span><br>
You who oft have boasted</p>

<p><span class="min1em">[<i>He pauses for a moment, then hurriedly, in order to gloss

<p class="poem20">
  That you are a man."</p>

<p class="poem05 top_0 bot_0">Of course that's only a rough idea.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. Are you going to sing it at the show?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span> [<i>jumping down from the table</i>]. You're always so
lukewarm. A man of artistic ideas is as sensitively skinned as
a baby.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. Do stay in, Pierrot. It's so cold outside.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. You want me to listen to you grumbling, I suppose.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. Just now you said I was always cheerful.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. There you are; girding at me again.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. I'm sorry, Pierrot. But the market-place is
dreadfully wet, and your shoes are awfully thin.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. I tell you I will not stop in. I'm going out to
find that girl. How do I know she isn't the very woman of
my dreams?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. Why are you always trying to picture an ideal
woman?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. Don't <i>you ever</i> picture an ideal man?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. No, I try to be practical.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. Women are so unimaginative! They are such
pathetic, motherly things, and when they feel extra motherly
they say, "I'm in love." All that is so sordid and petty. I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page083" name="page083"></a>(p. 083)</span> want a woman I can set on a pedestal, and just look up at
her and love her.</p>

habit of making myself at home everywhere. In fact, most people
think you can't make a <i>home</i> without <i>me</i>. May I put my
feet on the fender? It's an old habit of mine. I always do it.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. They say round here:</p>

<p class="poem20">
"Without feet on the fender<br>
Love is but slender."</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. Quite right. It is the whole secret of
the domestic fireside. Pierrette, you have been crying.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. I believe I have.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page085" name="page085"></a>(p. 085)</span> <span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. Bless you, I know all about it. It's
Pierrot. And so you're in love with him, and he doesn't care
a little bit about you, eh? What a strange old world it is!
And you cry your eyes out over him.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. Oh, no, I don't often cry. But to-night he
seemed more grumpy than usual, and I tried so hard to cheer
him up.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. Grumpy, is he?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. He doesn't mean it, though. It's the cold
weather, and the show hasn't been paying so well lately.
Pierrot wants to write an article about us for the local paper
by way of an advertisement. He thinks the editor may print
it if he gives him free passes for his family.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. Do you think Pierrot is worth your tears?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. Oh, yes!</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. You know, tears are not to be wasted.
We only have a certain amount of them given to us just for
keeping the heart moist. And when we've used them all up
and haven't any more, the heart dries up, too.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. Pierrot is a splendid fellow. You don't know
him as well as I do. It's true he's always discontented, but it's
only because he's not in love with anyone. You know, love does
make a tremendous difference in a man.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. That's true enough. And has it made
a difference in you?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. Oh, yes! I put Pierrot's slippers down to
warm, and I make tea for him, and all the time I'm happy because
I'm doing something for him. If I weren't in love, I
should find it a drudgery.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. Are you sure it's real love?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. Why, yes!</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. Every time you think of Pierrot, do you
hear the patter of little bare feet? And every time he speaks,
do you feel little chubby hands on your breast and face?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span> [<i>fervently</i>]. Yes! Oh, yes! That's just it!</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. You've got it right enough. But why is
it that Pierrot can wake up all this poetry in you?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. Because&mdash;oh, because he's just Pierrot.

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. "Because he's just Pierrot." The same
old reason.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. Of course, he is a bit dreamy. But that's his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page086" name="page086"></a>(p. 086)</span> soul. I am sure he could do great things if he tried. And have
you noticed his smile? Isn't it lovely! Sometimes, when he's
not looking, I want ever so much to try it on, just to see how
I should look in it. [<i>Pensively.</i>] But I wish he'd smile at
me a little more often, instead of at others.

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. Ho! So he smiles at others, does he?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. Hardly a day goes by but there's some fine lady
at the show. There was one there to-day, a tall girl with red
cheeks. He is gone to look for her now. And it is not their
faults. The poor things can't help being in love with him.
[<i>Proudly.</i>] I believe everyone is in love with Pierrot.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. But supposing one of these fine ladies
were to marry him?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. Oh, they'd never do that. A fine lady would
never marry a poor singer. If Pierrot were to get married, I
think I should just ... fade away.... Oh, but I don't
know why I talk to you like this. I feel as if I had known
you for a long, long time. [<span class="smcap">The Manufacturer</span> <i>rises from
the settle and moves across to</i> <span class="smcap">Pierrette</span>, <i>who is now folding

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span> [<i>very slowly</i>]. Perhaps you <i>have</i> known
me for a long, long time. [<i>His tone is so kindly and impressive
that</i> <span class="smcap">Pierrette</span> <i>forgets the table-cloth and looks up at him.

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span> [<i>taking a small bow from his side-pocket</i>]. Oh,
look at this.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span> [<i>in mock alarm</i>]. Oh, oh, I didn't mean
you to see that. I'd forgotten it was sticking out of my pocket.
I used to do a lot of archery at one time. I don't get much
chance now. [<i>He takes it and puts it back in his pocket.</i>]</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span> [<i>singing in the distance</i>].</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span> [<i>in a whisper as the voice draws nearer</i>].

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page087" name="page087"></a>(p. 087)</span> <span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. Pierrot. [<i>Again the conical white hat flashes

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. I can't find her anywhere. [<i>Seeing</i> <span class="smcap">The Manufacturer</span>.]
Hullo! Who are you?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. I am a stranger to you, but Pierrette
knew me in a moment.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. An old flame perhaps?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. True, I am an old flame. I've lighted
up the world for a considerable time. Yet when you say "old,"
there are many people who think I'm wonderfully well preserved
for my age. How long do you think I've been trotting
about?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span> [<i>testily, measuring a length with his hands</i>]. Oh,
about that long.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. I suppose being funny all day <i>does</i> get
on your nerves.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. Pierrot, you needn't be rude.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span> [<i>anxious to be alone with</i> <span class="smcap">Pierrot</span>].
Pierrette, have you got supper in?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrette</span>. Oh, I must fly! The shops will all be shut.
Will you be here when I come back?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span> [<i>bustling her out</i>]. I can't promise, but
I'll try, I'll try. [<span class="smcap">Pierrette</span> <i>goes out. There is a silence, during
which</i> <span class="smcap">The Manufacturer</span> <i>regards</i> <span class="smcap">Pierrot</span> <i>with amusement.</i>]</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. Well, friend Pierrot, so business is not
very brisk.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. Brisk! If laughter meant business, it would be
brisk enough, but there's no money. However, I've done one
good piece of work to-day. I've arranged with the editor to
put an article in the paper. That will fetch 'em. [<i>Singing</i>]:</p>

<p class="poem10">
"Please come one day and see our house that's down among the trees,<br>
But do not come at four o'clock for then we count the bees,<br>
And bath the tadpoles and the frogs, who splash the clouds with gold,<br>
And watch the new-cut cucum<i>bers</i> perspiring with the cold."</p>

<p class="poem05 top_0 bot_0">That's a song I'm writing.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. Pierrot, if you had all the money in the
world you wouldn't be happy.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page088" name="page088"></a>(p. 088)</span> <span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. Wouldn't I? Give me all the money in the world
and I'll risk it. To start with, I'd build schools to educate
the people up to high-class things.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer.</span> You dream of fame and wealth and
empty ideals, and you miss all the best things there are. You
are discontented. Why? Because you don't know how to be
happy.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span> [<i>reciting</i>]:</p>

<p class="poem20">
"Life's a running brooklet,<br>
<span class="add1em">Catch the fishes there,</span><br>
You who wrote a booklet<br>
<span class="add1em">On a woman's hair."</span></p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em">[<i>Explaining.</i>]</span> That's another song I'm writing. It's the
second verse. Things come to me all of a sudden like that.
I must run out a third verse, just to wind it up.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. Why don't you write a song without
any end, one that goes on for ever?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. I say, that's rather silly, isn't it?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. It all depends. For a song of that sort
the singer must be always happy.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. That wants a bit of doing in my line.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. Shall you and I transact a little business?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. By all means. What seats would you like? There
are the front rows covered in velvet, one shilling; wooden
benches behind, sixpence; and, right at the back, the twopenny
part. But, of course, you'll have shilling ones. How many
shall we say?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer.</span> You don't know who I am.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. That makes no difference. All are welcome,
and we thank you for your courteous attention.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. Pierrot, I am a maker of dreams.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. A what?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. I make all the dreams that float about
this musty world.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. I say, you'd better have a rest for a bit. I expect
you're a trifle done up.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. Pierrot, Pierrot, your superior mind can't
tumble to my calling. A child or one of the "people" would
in a moment. I am a maker of dreams, little things that glide
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page089" name="page089"></a>(p. 089)</span> about into people's hearts and make them glad. Haven't you
often wondered where the swallows go to in the autumn?
They come to my workshop, and tell me who wants a dream,
and what happened to the dreams they took with them in the
spring.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. Oh, I say, you can't expect me to believe that.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. When flowers fade, have you never wondered
where their colors go to, or what becomes of all the butterflies
in the winter? There isn't much winter about my
workshop.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. I had never thought of it before.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. It's a kind of lost property office, where
every beautiful thing that the world has neglected finds its way.
And there I make my celebrated dream, the dream that is
called "love."</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. Ho! ho! Now we're talking.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. You don't believe in it?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. Yes, in a way. But it doesn't last. It doesn't
last. If there is form, there isn't soul, and, if there is soul,
there isn't form. Oh, I've tried hard enough to believe it, but,
after the first wash, the colors run.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. You only got hold of a substitute. Wait
until you see the genuine article.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. But how is one to tell it?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. There are heaps of signs. As soon as
you get the real thing, your shoulder-blades begin to tingle.
That's love's wings sprouting. And, next, you want to soar
up among the stars and sit on the roof of heaven and sing to
the moon. Of course, that's because I put such a lot of the
moon into my dreams. I break bits off until it's nearly all
gone, and then I let it grow big again. It grows very quickly,
as I dare say you've noticed. After a fortnight it is ready for
use once more.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. This is most awfully fascinating. And do the
swallows bring all the dreams?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. Not always; I have other messengers.
Every night when the big clock strikes twelve, a day slips down
from the calendar, and runs away to my workshop in the Land
of Long Ago. I give him a touch of scarlet and a gleam of
gold, and say, "Go back, little Yesterday, and be a memory
in the world." But my best dreams I keep for to-day. I buy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page090" name="page090"></a>(p. 090)</span> babies, and fit them up with a dream, and then send them complete
and carriage paid ... in the usual manner.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. I've been dreaming all my life, but they've
always been dreams I made myself. I suppose I don't mix 'em
properly.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer.</span> You leave out the very essence of them.
You must put in a little sorrow, just to take away the over-sweetness.
I found that out very soon, so I took a little of the
fresh dew that made pearls in the early morning, and I
sprinkled my dreams with the gift of tears.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span> [<i>ecstatically</i>]. The gift of tears! How beautiful!
You know, I should rather like to try a real one. Not one of
my own making.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. Well, there are plenty about, if you only
look for them.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. That is all very well, but who's going to look
about for stray dreams?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. I once made a dream that would just suit
you. I slipped it inside a baby. That was twenty years ago,
and the baby is now a full-grown woman, with great blue eyes
and fair hair.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. It's a lot of use merely telling me about her.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. I'll do more. When I shipped her to
the world, I kept the bill of lading. Here it is. You shall
have it.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. Thanks, but what's the good of it?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. Why, the holder of that is able to claim
the goods; you will notice it contains a complete description,
too. I promise you, you're in luck.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. Has she red cheeks and a string of great beads?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. No.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. Ah, then it is not she. Where shall I find her?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. That's for you to discover. All you have
to do is to search.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. I'll start at once. [<i>He moves as if to go.</i>]</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. I shouldn't start out to-night.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. But I want to find her soon. Somebody else may
find her before me.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. Pierrot, there was once a man who
wanted to gather mushrooms.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span> [<i>annoyed at the commonplace</i>]. Mushrooms!</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page091" name="page091"></a>(p. 091)</span> <span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. Fearing people would be up before him,
he started out overnight. Morning came, and he found none,
so he returned disconsolate to his house. As he came through
the garden, he found a great mushroom had grown up in the
night by his very door-step. Take the advice of one who knows,
and wait a bit.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. If that's your advice.... But tell me this, do
you think I shall find her?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. I can't say for certain. Would you consider
yourself a fool?</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. Ah ... of course ... when you ask me a
direct thing like that, you make it ... er ... rather awkward
for me. But, if I may say so, as man to ma ... I
mean as man to ... [<i>he hesitates</i>].</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span> [<i>waiving the point</i>]. Yes, yes.</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Pierrot</span>. Well, I flatter myself that ...</p>

<p class="top_0 bot_0 poem05"><span class="min1em speaker">Manufacturer</span>. Exactly. And that's your principal danger.
Whilst you are striding along gazing at the stars, you
may be treading on a little glow-worm. Shall I give you a

<i>A WOOD-SHED COMMENTARY</i><br>
<span class="smaller">By<br>
PERCY MACKAYE</span></h1>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page097" name="page097"></a>(p. 097)</span> Percy MacKaye was born in New York, March 16, 1875,
the son of Steele MacKaye, a well-known dramatist and
theatrical inventor of his day. "My own early dramatic training,"
writes the son, "was in the theatre in relation with my
father's work there as dramatist, actor, and director." In
another place he says: "I have not sought to conceal, or to
put aside, the grateful enthusiasm I feel, as a son and comrade
of Steele MacKaye, for those examples of untiring devotion
to the theatre and of constructive achievement in its
art, by which his life has been an inspiration to my own, to
follow&mdash;however haltingly and through different means&mdash;the
trail of his large leadership." Percy MacKaye was graduated
from Harvard in 1897 and later spent a year studying at the
University of Leipzig. After travel abroad, he returned to
New York in 1900 and taught there in a private school till
1904. He spent some time in the next five years lecturing on
the Drama of Democracy and the Civic Theatre at various
American universities. In 1904 he joined the colony of artists
and men of letters at Cornish, New Hampshire, the home of
Saint-Gaudens, Maxfield Parrish, Winston Churchill, and
others. Since that date Percy MacKaye has devoted himself
wholly to poetry and the drama, writing community masques,
plays of various kinds, and operas.<a id="footnotetag32" name="footnotetag32"></a><a href="#footnote32" title="Go to footnote 32"><span class="smaller">[32]</span></a> It is interesting to note
that one of the latest products of his pen, <i>Washington, the Man
Who Made Us, A Ballad Play</i>, was translated into French
and presented by M. Copeau's players, at the Théâtre du
Vieux Colombier, during their second season in New York, and
later acted in English by Walter Hampden, the scene designs
being made by Robert Edmond Jones. In October, 1920, he
was invited to Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, not to teach
but to continue his own creative work, quite untrammeled,
filling there the first fellowship in creative literature ever established
in this country.</p>

<p><i>Yankee Fantasies</i>, a collection of five one-act plays of which
<i>Gettysburg</i> is one, is the expression of Percy MacKaye's belief
that the American dramatist may find "north of Boston," or,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page098" name="page098"></a>(p. 098)</span> in fact, in almost any rural neighborhood, material for "quaint
and lovely interpretation of our native environment now
ignored." These plays, published in 1912, testified also to his
conviction that the time had come for the development of the
one-act play in this country, not only because this form is distinctive
and capable of expressing what the full-length play
cannot, but also because a receptive audience was already organized.
He found even then that amateurs in schools, colleges,
and elsewhere were clamoring to perform one-act plays,
to see them performed, and to read them. At that date Little
Theatres were just beginning to be, but in the preface to
<i>Yankee Fantasies</i>, the author advocated the establishment of
Studio Theatres, in essence experimental, many of which have
since come into existence under different names, wherein playwrights
might practice the new craft of the one-act play as in
a workshop. The one-act play may be said to have arrived in
the nine years that have elapsed since <i>Gettysburg</i> was published.</p>

<p>The one-act play has shown no tendency, however, to rival
the short-story in the matter of local color. Kentucky, California,
Iowa, Louisiana, to name but a few of the favored
states which have served as rich backgrounds for many finely
flavored narratives of American life, have been neglected as
sources of dramatic material. But though Percy MacKaye may
perhaps be matched with Mary Wilkins, there is no writer who
has made notable use in the one-act play of localities, associated,
for example, with the art of George W. Cable, Bret
Harte, James Lane Allen, or Hamlin Garland. One of the
paths of glory for the American dramatist lies undoubtedly in
this direction.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Place is country New Hampshire, at the present time.</i></p>

<p class="opening"><span class="min10pc"><i>SCENE.&mdash;A woodshed, in the ell of a farm house.</i></span></p>

<p class="opening"><span class="min10pc"><i>The shed is open on both sides, front and back, the apertures
being slightly arched at the top. [In bad weather, these
presumably may be closed by big double doors, which
stand open now&mdash;swung back outward beyond sight.]
Thus the nearer opening is the proscenium arch of the
scene, under which the spectator looks through the shed
to the background&mdash;a grassy yard, a road with great
trunks of soaring elms, and the glimpse of a green hillside.
The ceiling runs up into a gable with large beams.</i></span></p>

<p class="opening"><span class="min10pc"><i>On the right, at back, a door opens into the shed from the house
kitchen. Opposite it, a door leads from the shed into the
barn. In the foreground, against the right wall, is a
work-bench. On this are tools, a long, narrow, wooden
box, and a small oil stove, with steaming kettle upon it.</i></span></p>

<p class="opening"><span class="min10pc"><i>Against the left wall, what remains of the year's wood supply
is stacked, the uneven ridges sloping to a jumble of stove-wood
and kindlings mixed with small chips on the floor,
which is piled deep with mounds of crumbling bark, chips
and wood-dust.</i></span></p>

<p class="opening"><span class="min10pc"><i>Not far from this mounded pile, at right center of the scene,
stands a wooden arm-chair, in which</i> <span class="smcap">Link Tadbourne</span>,
<i>in his shirt-sleeves, sits drowsing. Silhouetted by the sunlight
beyond, his sharp-drawn profile is that of an old man,
with white hair cropped close, and gray mustache of a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100"></a>(p. 100)</span> faded black hue at the outer edges. Between his knees is
a stout thong of wood, whittled round by the drawshave
which his sleeping hand still holds in his lap. Against the
side of his chair rests a thick wooden yoke and collar.
Near him is a chopping-block.</i></span></p>

<p class="opening"><span class="min10pc"><i>In the woodshed there is no sound or motion except the hum
and floating steam from the tea-kettle. Presently the old
man murmurs in his sleep, clenching his hand. Slowly the
hand relaxes again. From the door, right, comes</i> <span class="smcap">Polly</span>&mdash;<i>a
sweet-faced girl of seventeen, quietly mature for her age.
She is dressed simply. In one hand, she carries a man's
wide-brimmed felt hat; over the other arm, a blue coat.
These she brings toward</i> <span class="smcap">Link</span>. <i>Seeing him asleep, she begins
to tiptoe, lays the coat and hat on the chopping-block,
goes to the bench and trims the wick of the oil-stove, under
the kettle. Then she returns and stands near</i> <span class="smcap">Link</span>, <i>surveying
the shed.</i></span></p>

<p class="opening"><span class="min10pc"><i>On closer scrutiny, the jumbled woodpile has evidently a certain
order in its chaos: some of the splittings have been
piled in irregular ridges; in places, the deep layer of wood-dust
and chips has been scooped, and the little mounds slope
and rise like miniature valleys and hills.<a id="footnotetag33" name="footnotetag33"></a><a href="#footnote33" title="Go to footnote 33"><span class="smaller">[33]</span></a></i></span></p>

That's whar us Yanks left our back door ajar<br>

Chick, look a-thar: them little stripes and stars.<br>
I heerd a feller onct, down to the store,&mdash;<br>
a dressy mister, span-new from the city&mdash;<br>
layin' the law down: "All this <i>stars and stripes</i>,"<br>
says he, "and <i>red and white and blue</i> is rubbish,<br>
mere sentimental rot, spread-eagleism!"<br>
"I wan't t' know!" says I. "In Sixty-three,<br>
I knowed a lad, named Link. Onct, after sundown<br>
I met him stumblin'&mdash;with two dead men's muskets<br>
for crutches&mdash;towards a bucket, full of ink&mdash;<br>
water, they called it. When he'd drunk a spell,<br>
he tuk the rest to wash his bullet holes.&mdash;<br>
Wall, sir, he had a piece o' splintered stick,<br>
with <i>red and white and blue</i>, tore 'most t' tatters,<br>
a-danglin' from it." "Be you color sergeant?"<br>
says I. "Not me," says Link; "the sergeant's dead,<br>
but when he fell, he handed me this bit<br>
o' <i>rubbish</i>&mdash;red and white and blue." And Link<br>
he laughed. "What be you laughin' for?" says I.<br>
"Oh, nothin'. Ain't it lovely, though!" says Link.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Polly</span>.<br>
What did the span-new mister say to that?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Link</span>.<br>
I didn't stop to listen. Them as never<br>

<i>A COMEDY IN ONE ACT</i><br>
<span class="smaller">By</span><br>
A. A. MILNE</h1>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page113" name="page113"></a>(p. 113)</span> Alan Alexander Milne was born January 18, 1882. He
was a student at Westminster School, the library of which is
familiar ground to every reader of Irving's <i>Sketch Book</i>. From
there he proceeded to Trinity College, Cambridge. On his
graduation, he went into journalism in London. He was assistant
editor of <i>Punch</i> from 1906 to 1914. During the War
he was a lieutenant in the Fourth Royal Warwickshire Regiment.
In the introduction to his volume of <i>First Plays</i>, in which
<i>Wurzel-Flummery</i> appears, he gives the following whimsical
account of his career as a dramatist: "These five plays [<i>The
Lucky One</i>, <i>The Boy Comes Home</i>, <i>Belinda</i>, <i>The Red Feather</i>,
<i>Wurzel-Flummery</i>] were written in the order in which they
appear now, during the years 1916 and 1917. They would
hardly have been written had it not been for the War, although
only one of them is concerned with that subject. To his other
responsibilities the Kaiser now adds this volume.</p>

<p>"For these plays were not the work of a professional writer,
but the recreation of a (temporary) professional soldier. Play-writing
is a luxury to a journalist, as insidious as golf and
much more expensive in time and money. When an article is
written, the financial reward (and we may as well live as not)
is a matter of certainty. A novelist, too, even if he is not in
'the front rank'&mdash;but I never heard of one who wasn't&mdash;can
at least be sure of publication. But when a play is written,
there is no certainty of anything save disillusionment.</p>

<p>"To write a play, then, while I was a journalist seemed to
me a depraved proceeding, almost as bad as going to Lord's
in the morning. I thought I could write one (we all think we
can), but I could not afford so unpromising a gamble. But
once in the Army the case was altered. No duty now urged
me to write. My job was soldiering, and my spare time was
my own affair. Other subalterns played bridge and golf; that
was one way of amusing oneself. Another way was&mdash;why
not?&mdash;to write plays.</p>

<p>"So we began with <i>Wurzel-Flummery</i>. I say 'we,' because
another is mixed up in this business even more seriously than
the Kaiser. She wrote; I dictated. And if a particularly fine
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name="page114"></a>(p. 114)</span> evening drew us out for a walk along the byways&mdash;where there
was no saluting, and one could smoke a pipe without shocking
the Duke of Cambridge&mdash;then it was to discuss the last scene
and to wonder what would happen in the next. We did not
estimate the money or publicity which might come from this
new venture; there has never been any serious thought of making
money by my bridge-playing, nor desire for publicity when
I am trying to play golf. But secretly, of course, we hoped.
It was that which made it so much more exciting than any
other game.</p>

<p>"Our hopes were realized to the following extent:</p>

<p>"Wurzel-Flummery was produced by Mr. Dion Boucicault
at the New Theatre in April, 1917. It was originally written
in three acts, in which form it was shown to one or two
managers. At the beginning of 1917 I was offered the chance
of production in a triple bill if I cut it down into a two-act
play. To cut even a line is painful, but to cut thirty pages of
one's first comedy, slaughtering whole characters on the way,
has at least a certain morbid fascination. It appeared, therefore,
in two acts; and one kindly critic embarrassed us by
saying that a lesser artist would have written it in three acts,
and most of the other critics annoyed us by saying that a greater
artist would have written it in one act. However, I amused
myself some months later by slaying another character&mdash;the
office-boy, no less&mdash;thereby getting it down to one act, and was
surprised to find that the one-act version was, after all, the
best.... At least, I think it is.... At any rate, that is
the version I am printing here; but, as can be imagined, I am
rather tired of the whole business by now, and I am beginning
to wonder if anyone ever did take the name of Wurzel-Flummery
at all. Possibly the whole thing is an invention."</p>

<p><i>Wurzel-Flummery</i> was first produced in this country at the
Arts and Crafts Theatre in Detroit; recently it was acted again
by The Players of St. Louis.</p>

<p class="opening"><span class="min10pc"><i>It is a June day before the War in the morning-room of</i>
<span class="smcap">Robert Crawshaw's</span> <i>town house. Entering it with our
friend the house-agent, our attention would first be called
to the delightful club fender round the fireplace. On one
side of this a Chesterfield sofa comes out at right angles.
In a corner of the sofa</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Viola Crawshaw</span> <i>is sitting,
deep in "The Times." The house-agent would hesitate
to catalogue her, but we notice for ourselves, before he
points out the comfortable armchair opposite, that she is
young and pretty. In the middle of the room and facing
the fireplace is (observe) a solid knee-hole writing-table,
covered with papers and books of reference, and supported
by a chair at the middle and another at the side. The rest
of the furniture, and the books and pictures round the
walls, we must leave until another time, for at this moment
the door behind the sofa opens and</i> <span class="smcap">Richard
Meriton</span> <i>comes in. He looks about thirty-five, has a
clean-shaven intelligent face, and is dressed in a dark tweed
suit. We withdraw hastily, as he comes behind</i> <span class="smcap">Viola</span> <i>and
puts his hands over her eyes.</i></span></p>

<div class="gettys">
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. Three guesses who it is.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span> [<i>putting her hands over his</i>]. The Archbishop of
Canterbury.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page116" name="page116"></a>(p. 116)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. The Archbishop of York.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. Fortunately that exhausts the archbishops. Now,
then, your last guess.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. Richard Meriton, M.P.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. Wonderful! [<i>He kisses the top of her head
lightly and goes round to the club fender, where he sits with
his back to the fireplace.</i>] How did you know? [<i>He begins
to fill a pipe.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. Well, it couldn't have been father.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. N-no, I suppose not. Not just after breakfast
anyway. Anything in the paper?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. There's a letter from father pointing out that &mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. I never knew such a man as Robert for pointing
out.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. Anyhow, it's in big print.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. It would be.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola.</span> You are very cynical this morning, Dick.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. The sausages were cold, dear.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. Poor Dick! Oh, Dick, I wish you were on the
same side as father.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. But he's on the wrong side. Surely I've told
you that before.... Viola, do you really think it would
make a difference?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. Well, you know what he said about you at Basingstoke
the other day.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. No, I don't, really.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. He said that your intellectual arrogance was only
equaled by your spiritual instability. I don't quite know what
it means, but it doesn't sound the sort of thing you want in a
son-in-law.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. Still, it was friendly of him to go right away to
Basingstoke to say it. Anyhow, you don't believe it.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. Of course not.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. And Robert doesn't really.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. Then why does he say it?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. Ah, now you're opening up very grave questions.
The whole structure of the British Constitution rests upon
Robert's right to say things like that at Basingstoke....
But really, darling, we're very good friends. He's always asking
my advice about things&mdash;he doesn't take it, of course, but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page117" name="page117"></a>(p. 117)</span> still he asks it; and it was awfully good of him to insist on my
staying here while my flat was being done up. [<i>Seriously.</i>] I
bless him for that. If it hadn't been for the last week I
should never have known you. You were just "Viola"&mdash;the
girl I'd seen at odd times since she was a child; and now&mdash;oh,
why won't you let me tell your father? I hate it like
this.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. Because I love you, Dick, and because I know
father. He would, as they say in novels, show you the door.
[<i>Smiling.</i>] And I want you this side of the door for a little
bit longer.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span> [<i>firmly</i>]. I shall tell him before I go.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span> [<i>pleadingly</i>]. But not till then; that gives us two
more days. You see, darling, it's going to take me all I know
to get round him. You see, apart from politics you're so poor&mdash;and
father hates poor people.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span> [<i>viciously</i>]. Damn money!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span> [<i>thoughtfully</i>]. I think that's what father means by
spiritual instability.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. Viola! [<i>He stands up and holds out his arms to
her. She goes to him and</i>&mdash;] Oh, Lord, look out!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span> [<i>reaching across to the mantelpiece</i>]. Matches?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. Thanks very much. [<i>He lights his pipe as</i>
<span class="smcap">Robert Crawshaw</span> <i>comes in.</i> <span class="smcap">Crawshaw</span> <i>is forty-five, but
his closely-trimmed mustache and whiskers, his inclination to
stoutness, and the loud old-gentlemanly style in trousers which
he affects with his morning-coat, make him look older, and,
what is more important, the Pillar of the State which he undoubtedly
is.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. Good-morning, Richard. Down at last?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. Good-morning. I did warn you, didn't I, that
I was bad at breakfasts?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. Viola, where's your mother?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span> [<i>making for the door</i>]. I don't know, father; do
you want her?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. I wish to speak to her.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. All right, I'll tell her. [<i>She goes out.</i> <span class="smcap">Richard</span>
<i>picks up "The Times" and sits down again.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>sitting down in a business-like way at his desk</i>].
Richard, why don't you get something to do?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. My dear fellow, I've only just finished breakfast.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page118" name="page118"></a>(p. 118)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. I mean generally. And apart, of course, from
your&mdash;ah&mdash;work in the House.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span> [<i>a trifle cool</i>]. I have something to do.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. Oh, reviewing. I mean something serious.
You should get a directorship or something in the City.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. I hate the City.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. Ah! there, my dear Richard, is that intellectual
arrogance to which I had to call attention the other day at
Basingstoke.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span> [<i>dryly</i>]. Yes, so Viola was telling me.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. You understood, my dear fellow, that I meant
nothing personal. [<i>Clearing his throat.</i>] It is justly one of
the proudest boasts of the Englishman that his political enmities
are not allowed to interfere with his private friendships.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span> [<i>carelessly</i>]. Oh, I shall go to Basingstoke myself
one day.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span class="min1em"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>. <span class="smcap">Margaret</span> <i>has been in love with</i> <span class="smcap">Robert
Crawshaw</span> <i>for twenty-five years, the last twenty-four
years from habit. She is small, comfortable, and rather
foolish; you would certainly call her a dear, but you might
sometimes call her a poor dear.</i></span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em;"><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. Good-morning, Mr. Meriton. I do hope your
breakfast was all right.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. Excellent, thank you.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. That's right. Did you want me, Robert?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>obviously uncomfortable</i>]. Yes&mdash;er&mdash;h'r'm&mdash;Richard&mdash;er&mdash;what
are your&mdash;er&mdash;plans?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. Is he trying to get rid of me, Mrs. Crawshaw?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. Of course not. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Robert</span>.] Are you, dear?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. Perhaps we had better come into my room,
Margaret. We can leave Richard here with the paper.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. No, no; I'm going.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>going to the door with him</i>]. I have some particular
business to discuss. If you aren't going out, I should
like to consult you in the matter afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. Right. [<i>He goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. Sit down, Margaret. I have some extraordinary
news for you.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span> [<i>sitting down</i>]. Yes, Robert?</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page119" name="page119"></a>(p. 119)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. This letter has just come by hand. [<i>He reads
it.</i>] "199, Lincoln's Inn Fields. Dear Sir, I have the pleasure
to inform you that under the will of the late Mr. Antony
Clifton you are a beneficiary to the extent of £50,000."</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. Robert!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. Wait! "A trifling condition is attached&mdash;namely,
that you should take the name of&mdash;Wurzel-Flummery."</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. Robert!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. "I have the honor to be, your obedient
servant, Denis Clifton." [<i>He folds the letter up and puts it
away.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. Robert, whoever is he? I mean the one who's
left you the money?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>calmly</i>]. I have not the slightest idea, Margaret.
Doubtless we shall find out before long. I have asked
Mr. Denis Clifton to come and see me.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. Leaving you fifty thousand pounds! Just
fancy!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. Wurzel-Flummery!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. We can have the second car now, dear, can't
we? And what about moving? You know you always said
you ought to be in a more central part. Mr. Robert Crawshaw,
M.P., of Curzon Street sounds so much more&mdash;more
Cabinety.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. Mr. Robert Wurzel-Flummery, M.P., of
Curzon Street&mdash;I don't know what <i>that</i> sounds like.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. I expect that's only a legal way of putting it,
dear. They can't really expect us to change our name to&mdash;Wurzley-Fothergill.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. Wurzel-Flummery.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. Yes, dear, didn't I say that? I am sure you
could talk the solicitor round&mdash;this Mr. Denis Clifton. After
all, it doesn't matter to <i>him</i> what we call ourselves. Write
him one of your letters, dear.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. You don't seem to apprehend the situation,
Margaret.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. Yes, I do, dear. This Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. Antony Clifton.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. Yes, he's left you fifty thousand pounds, together
with the name of Wurzley-Fothergill&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. Wurzel&mdash;oh, well, never mind.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page120" name="page120"></a>(p. 120)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. Yes, well, you tell the solicitor that you will
take the fifty thousand pounds, but you don't want the name.
It's too absurd, when everybody knows of Robert Crawshaw,
M.P., to expect you to call yourself Wurzley-Fothergill.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>impatiently</i>]. Yes, yes. The point is that this
Mr. Clifton has left me the money on <i>condition</i> that I change
my name. If I don't take the name, I don't take the money.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. But is that legal?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. Perfectly. It is often done. People change
their names on succeeding to some property.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. I thought it was only when your name was
Moses and you changed it to Talbot.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>to himself</i>]. Wurzel-Flummery!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. I wonder why he left you the money at all.
Of course it was very nice of him, but if you didn't know
him&mdash;Why do you think he did, dear?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. I know no more than this letter. I suppose
he had&mdash;ah&mdash;followed my career, and was&mdash;ah&mdash;interested in
it, and being a man with no relations, felt that he could&mdash;ah&mdash;safely
leave this money to me. No doubt Wurzel-Flummery
was his mother's maiden name, or the name of some other friend
even dearer to him; he wished the name&mdash;ah&mdash;perpetuated,
perhaps even recorded not unworthily in the history of our
country, and&mdash;ah&mdash;made this will accordingly. In a way it
is a kind of&mdash;ah&mdash;sacred trust.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. Then, of course, you'll accept it, dear?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. It requires some consideration. I have my
career to think about, my duty to my country.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. Of course, dear. Money is a great help in
politics, isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. Money wisely spent is a help in any profession.
The view of riches which socialists and suchlike people
profess to take is entirely ill-considered. A rich man, who
spends his money thoughtfully, is serving his country as nobly
as anybody.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. Yes, dear. Then you think we <i>could</i> have that
second car and the house in Curzon Street?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. We must not be led away. Fifty thousand
pounds, properly invested, is only two thousand a year. When
you have deducted the income-tax&mdash;and the tax on unearned
income is extremely high just now&mdash;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page121" name="page121"></a>(p. 121)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. Oh, but surely if we have to call ourselves
Wurzel-Flummery it would count as <i>earned</i> income.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. I fear not. Strictly speaking, all money is
earned. Even if it is left to you by another, it is presumably
left to you in recognition of certain outstanding qualities which
you possess. But Parliament takes a different view. I do not
for a moment say that fifty thousand pounds would not be
welcome. Fifty thousand pounds is certainly not to be sneezed
at&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. I should think not, indeed!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>unconsciously rising from his chair</i>]. And
without this preposterous condition attached I should be pleased
to accept this trust, and I would endeavor, Mr. Speaker&mdash;[<i>He
sits down again suddenly.</i>] I would endeavor, Margaret,
to carry it out to the best of my poor ability. But&mdash;Wurzel-Flummery!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. You would soon get used to it, dear. I had to
get used to the name of Crawshaw after I had been Debenham
for twenty-five years. It is surprising how quickly it comes to
you. I think I only signed my name Margaret Debenham once
after I was married.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>kindly</i>]. The cases are rather different, Margaret.
Naturally a woman, who from her cradle looks forward
to the day when she will change her name, cannot have this
feeling for the&mdash;ah&mdash;honor of his name, which every man&mdash;ah&mdash;feels.
Such a feeling is naturally more present in my own
case since I have been privileged to make the name of Crawshaw
in some degree&mdash;ah&mdash;well-known, I might almost say
famous.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span> [<i>wistfully</i>]. I used to be called "the beautiful
Miss Debenham of Leamington." Everybody in Leamington
knew of me. Of course, I am very proud to be Mrs. Robert
Crawshaw.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>getting up and walking over to the fireplace</i>].
In a way it would mean beginning all over again. It is half
the battle in politics to get your name before the public. "Whoever
is this man Wurzel-Flummery?" people will say.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. Anyhow, dear, let us look on the bright side.
Fifty thousand pounds is fifty thousand pounds.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. It is, Margaret. And no doubt it is my duty
to accept it. But&mdash;well, all I say is that a <i>gentleman</i> would
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page122" name="page122"></a>(p. 122)</span> have left it without any conditions. Or at least he would
merely have expressed his <i>wish</i> that I should take the name,
without going so far as to enforce it. Then I could have
looked at the matter all round in an impartial spirit.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span> [<i>pursuing her thoughts</i>]. The linen is marked
R. M. C. now. Of course, we should have to have that altered.
Do you think R. M. F. would do, or would it have to be
R. M. W. hyphen F.?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. What? Oh&mdash;yes, there will be a good deal
of that to attend to. [<i>Going up to her.</i>] I think, Margaret,
I had better talk to Richard about this. Of course, it would
be absurd to refuse the money, but&mdash;well, I should like to have
his opinion.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span> [<i>getting up</i>]. Do you think he would be very
sympathetic, dear? He makes jokes about serious things&mdash;like
bishops and hunting&mdash;just as if they weren't at all serious.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. I wish to talk to him just to obtain a new&mdash;ah&mdash;point
of view. I do not hold myself in the least bound
to act on anything he says. I regard him as a constituent,
Margaret.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. Then I will send him to you.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>putting his hands on her shoulders</i>]. Margaret,
what do you really feel about it?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. Just whatever <i>you</i> feel, Robert.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>kissing her</i>]. Thank you, Margaret; you are
a good wife to me. [<i>She goes out.</i> <span class="smcap">Crawshaw</span> <i>goes to his
desk and selects a "Who's Who" from a little pile of reference-books
on it. He walks round to his chair, sits down in it and
begins to turn the pages, murmuring names beginning with
"C" to himself as he gets near the place. When he finds it,
he murmurs "Clifton&mdash;that's funny" and closes the book.
Evidently the publishers have failed him.</i>]</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Richard</span>.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. Well, what's the news? [<i>He goes to his old seat
on the fender.</i>] Been left a fortune?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>simply</i>]. Yes.... By a Mr. Antony Clifton.
I never met him and I know nothing about him.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span> [<i>surprised</i>]. Not really? Well, I congratulate
you. [<i>He sighs.</i>] To them that hath&mdash;But what on earth
do you want my advice about?</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page123" name="page123"></a>(p. 123)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. There is a slight condition attached.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. Oho!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. The condition is that with this money&mdash;fifty
thousand pounds&mdash;I take the name of&mdash;ah&mdash;Wurzel-Flummery.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span> [<i>jumping up</i>]. What!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>sulkily</i>]. I said it quite distinctly&mdash;Wurzel-Flummery.
[<span class="smcap">Richard</span> <i>in an awed silence walks over to the
desk and stands looking down at the unhappy</i> <span class="smcap">Crawshaw</span>. <i>He
throws out his left hand as if introducing him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span> [<i>reverently</i>]. Mr. Robert Wurzel-Flummery,
M.P., one of the most prominent of our younger Parliamentarians.
Oh, you ... oh!... oh, how too heavenly!
[<i>He goes back to his seat, looks up and catches</i> <span class="smcap">Crawshaw's</span>
<i>eye, and breaks down altogether.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>rising with dignity</i>]. Shall we discuss it seriously,
or shall we leave it?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. How can we discuss a name like Wurzel-Flummery
seriously? "Mr. Wurzel-Flummery in a few well-chosen
words seconded the motion." ... "'Sir,' went on
Mr. Wurzel-Flummery"&mdash;Oh, poor Robert!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>sitting down sulkily</i>]. You seem quite certain
that I shall take the money.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. I am quite certain.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. Would <i>you</i> take it?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span> [<i>hesitating</i>]. Well&mdash;I wonder.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. After all, as William Shakespeare says, "What's
in a name?"</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. I can tell you something else that Shakespeare&mdash;<i>William</i>
Shakespeare&mdash;said. [<i>Dramatically rising.</i>] Who steals
my purse with fifty thousand in it&mdash;steals trash. [<i>In his
natural voice.</i>] Trash, Robert. [<i>Dramatically again.</i>] But
he who filches from me my good name of Crawshaw [<i>lightly</i>]
and substitutes the rotten one of Wurzel&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>annoyed</i>]. As a matter of fact, Wurzel-Flummery
is a very good old name. I seem to remember some&mdash;ah&mdash;Hampshire
Wurzel-Flummeries. It is a very laudable
spirit on the part of a dying man to wish to&mdash;ah&mdash;perpetuate
these old English names. It all seems to me quite natural and
straightforward. If I take this money I shall have nothing to
be ashamed of.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page124" name="page124"></a>(p. 124)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. I see.... Look here, may I ask you a few
questions? I should like to know just how you feel about the
whole business?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>complacently folding his hands</i>]. Go ahead.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. Suppose a stranger came up in the street to you
and said, "My poor man, here's five pounds for you," what
would you do? Tell him to go to the devil, I suppose,
wouldn't you?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>humorously</i>]. In more parliamentary language,
perhaps, Richard. I should tell him I never took money
from strangers.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. Quite so; but that if it were ten thousand pounds,
you would take it?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. I most certainly shouldn't.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. But if he died and left it to you, <i>then</i> you would?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>blandly</i>]. Ah, I thought you were leading up
to that. That, of course, is entirely different.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. Why?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. Well&mdash;ah&mdash;wouldn't <i>you</i> take ten thousand
pounds if it were left to you by a stranger?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. I daresay I should. But I should like to know
why it would seem different.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>professionally</i>]. Ha&mdash;hum! Well&mdash;in the first
place, when a man is dead he wants his money no longer. You
can therefore be certain that you are not taking anything from
him which he cannot spare. And in the next place, it is the
man's dying wish that you should have the money. To refuse
would be to refuse the dead. To accept becomes almost a
sacred duty.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. It really comes to this, doesn't it? You won't
take it from him when he's alive, because if you did, you
couldn't decently refuse him a little gratitude; but you know
that it doesn't matter a damn to him what happens to his
money after he's dead, and therefore you can take it without
feeling any gratitude at all.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. No, I shouldn't put it like that.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. I'm sure you wouldn't, Robert.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. No doubt you can twist it about so that&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. All right, we'll leave that and go on to the next
point. Suppose a perfect stranger offered you five pounds to
part your hair down the middle, shave off your mustache, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page125" name="page125"></a>(p. 125)</span> wear only one whisker&mdash;if he met you suddenly in the street,
seemed to dislike your appearance, took out a fiver and begged
you to hurry off and alter yourself&mdash;of course you'd pocket the
money and go straight to your barber's?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. Now you are merely being offensive.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. I beg your pardon. I should have said that if
he had left you five pounds in his will?&mdash;well, then twenty
pounds?&mdash;a hundred pounds?&mdash;a thousand pounds?&mdash;fifty thousand
pounds?&mdash;[<i>Jumping up excitedly.</i>] It's only a question
of price&mdash;fifty thousand pounds, Robert&mdash;a pink tie with
purple spots, hair parted across the back, trousers with a patch
in the seat, call myself Wurzel-Flummery&mdash;any old thing you
like, you can't insult me&mdash;anything you like, gentlemen, for fifty
thousand pounds. [<i>Lowering his voice.</i>] Only you must leave
it in your will, and then I can feel that it is a sacred duty&mdash;a
sacred duty, my lords and gentlemen. [<i>He sinks back into
the sofa and relights his pipe.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>rising with dignity</i>]. It is evidently useless to
prolong this conversation.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span> [<i>waving him down again</i>]. No, no, Robert; I've
finished. I just took the other side&mdash;and I got carried away.
I ought to have been at the Bar.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. You take such extraordinary views of things.
You must look facts in the face, Richard. This is a modern
world, and we are modern people living in it. Take the
matter-of-fact view. You may like or dislike the name of&mdash;ah&mdash;Wurzel-Flummery,
but you can't get away from the fact
that fifty thousand pounds is not to be sneezed at.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span> [<i>wistfully</i>]. I don't know why people shouldn't
sneeze at money sometimes. I should like to start a society
for sneezing at fifty thousand pounds. We'd have to begin in
a small way, of course; we'd begin by sneezing at five pounds&mdash;and
work up.... The trouble is that we're all inoculated
in our cradles against that kind of cold.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>pleasantly</i>]. You will have your little joke.
But you know as well as I do that it is only a joke. There
can be no serious reason why I should not take this money.
And I&mdash;ah&mdash;gather that you don't think it will affect my
career?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span> [<i>carelessly</i>]. Not a bit. It'll help it. It'll get
you into all the comic papers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><span class="min1em"><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> <i>comes in at this moment, to the relief of</i> <span class="smcap">Crawshaw</span>,
<i>who is not quite certain if he is being flattered or
insulted again.</i></span></p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. Well, have you told him?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span> [<i>making way for her on the sofa</i>]. I have heard
the news, Mrs. Crawshaw. And I have told Robert my opinion
that he should have no difficulty in making the name of Wurzel-Flummery
as famous as he has already made that of Crawshaw.
At any rate I hope he will.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. How nice of you!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. Well, it's settled then. [<i>Looking at his watch.</i>]
This solicitor fellow should be here soon. Perhaps, after all,
we can manage something about&mdash;Ah, Viola, did you want
your mother?</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Viola</span>.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. Sorry, do I interrupt a family meeting? There's
Richard, so it can't be very serious.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. What a reputation!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. Well, it's over now.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. Viola had better know, hadn't she?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. She'll have to know some time, of course.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span> [<i>sitting down firmly on the sofa</i>]. Of course she will.
So you'd better tell her now. I knew there was something
exciting going on this morning.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>embarrassed</i>]. Hum&mdash;ha&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>.]
Perhaps you'd better tell her, dear.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span> [<i>simply and naturally</i>]. Father has come into
some property, Viola. It means changing our name unfortunately.
But your father doesn't think it will matter.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. How thrilling! What is the name, mother?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. Your father says it is&mdash;dear me, I shall never
remember it.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>mumbling</i>]. Wurzel-Flummery.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span> [<i>after a pause</i>]. Dick, <i>you</i> tell me, if nobody else
will.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. Robert said it just now.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. That wasn't a name, was it? I thought it was just
a&mdash;do say it again, father.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>sulkily but plainly</i>]. Wurzel-Flummery.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page127" name="page127"></a>(p. 127)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span> [<i>surprised</i>]. Do you spell it like that? I mean like
a wurzel and like flummery?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. Exactly, I believe.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span> [<i>to herself</i>]. Miss Viola Wurzel-Flummery&mdash;I
mean they'd have to look at you, wouldn't they? [<i>Bubbling
over.</i>] Oh, Dick, what a heavenly name! Who had
it first?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. They are an old Hampshire family&mdash;that is so,
isn't it, Robert?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>annoyed</i>]. I said I thought that I remembered&mdash;Margaret,
can you find Burke there? [<i>She finds it, and he
buries himself in the families of the great.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. Well, Viola, you haven't told us how you like
being Miss Wurzel-Flummery.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. I haven't realized myself yet, mummy. I shall have
to stand in front of my glass and tell myself who I am.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. It's all right for <i>you</i>. You know you'll change
your name one day, and then it won't matter what you've been
called before.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span> [<i>secretly</i>]. H'sh! [<i>She smiles lovingly at him, and
then says aloud.</i>] Oh, won't it? It's got to appear in the
papers, "A marriage has been arranged between Miss Viola
Wurzel-Flummery ..." and everybody will say, "And about
time too, poor girl."</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span> [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Crawshaw</span>]. Have you found it, dear?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>resentfully</i>]. This is the 1912 edition.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. Still, dear, if it's a very old family, it ought
to be in by then.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. I don't mind how old it is; I think it's lovely. Oh,
Dick, what fun it will be being announced! Just think of the
footman throwing open the door and saying&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maid</span> [<i>announcing</i>]. Mr. Denis Clifton. [<i>There is a little
natural confusion as</i> <span class="smcap">Clifton</span> <i>enters jauntily in his summer
suiting with a bundle of papers under his arm.</i> <span class="smcap">Crawshaw</span>
<i>goes towards him and shakes hands.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. How do you do, Mr. Clifton? Very good of
you to come. [<i>Looking doubtfully at his clothes.</i>] Er&mdash;it is
Mr. Denis Clifton, the solicitor?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span> [<i>cheerfully</i>]. It is. I must apologize for not looking
the part more, but my clothes did not arrive from Clarkson's
in time. Very careless of them when they had promised.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page128" name="page128"></a>(p. 128)</span> And my clerk dissuaded me from the side-whiskers which I keep
by me for these occasions.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>bewildered</i>]. Ah yes, quite so. But you have&mdash;ah&mdash;full
legal authority to act in this matter?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span>. Oh, decidedly. Oh, there's no question of that.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>introducing</i>]. My wife&mdash;and daughter.
[<span class="smcap">Clifton</span> <i>bows gracefully.</i>] My friend, Mr. Richard
Meriton.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span> [<i>happily</i>]. Dear me! Mr. Meriton too! This
is quite a situation, as we say in the profession.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span> [<i>amused by him</i>]. In the legal profession?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span>. In the theatrical profession. [<i>Turning to</i> <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>.]
I am a writer of plays, Mrs. Crawshaw. I am not
giving away a professional secret when I tell you that most of
the managers in London have thanked me for submitting my
work to them.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>firmly</i>]. I understood, Mr. Clifton, that you
were the solicitor employed to wind up the affairs of the late
Mr. Antony Clifton.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span>. Oh, certainly. Oh, there's no doubt about my
being a solicitor. My clerk, a man of the utmost integrity, not
to say probity, would give me a reference. I am in the books;
I belong to the Law Society. But my heart turns elsewhere.
Officially I have embraced the profession of a solicitor&mdash;[<i>Frankly,
to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Crawshaw</span>.] But you know what these
official embraces are.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span>. I'm afraid&mdash;[<i>She turns to her husband for
assistance.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span> [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Richard</span>]. Unofficially, Mr. Meriton, I am
wedded to the Muses.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. Dick, isn't he lovely?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. Quite so. But just for the moment, Mr.
Clifton, I take it that we are concerned with legal business.
Should I ever wish to produce a play, the case would be different.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span>. Admirably put. Pray regard me entirely as the
solicitor for as long as you wish. [<i>He puts his hat down on a
chair with the papers in it, and taking off his gloves, goes on
dreamily.</i>] Mr. Denis Clifton was superb as a solicitor. In
spite of an indifferent make-up, his manner of taking off his
gloves and dropping them into his hat&mdash;[<i>He does so.</i>]</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page129" name="page129"></a>(p. 129)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span> [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Crawshaw</span>]. I think, perhaps, Viola
and I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span> [<i>making a move too</i>]. We'll leave you to your
business, Robert.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span> [<i>holding up his hand</i>]. Just one moment if I may.
I have a letter for you, Mr. Meriton.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span> [<i>surprised</i>]. For me?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span>. Yes. My clerk, a man of the utmost integrity&mdash;oh,
but I said that before&mdash;he took it round to your rooms this
morning, but found only painters and decorators there. [<i>He is
feeling in his pockets and now brings the letter out.</i>] I brought
it along, hoping that Mr. Crawshaw&mdash;but of course I never
expected anything so delightful as this. [<i>He hands over the
letter with a bow.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. Thanks. [<i>He puts it in his pocket.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span>. Oh, but do read it now, won't you? [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Crawshaw</span>.] One so rarely has an opportunity of being
present when one's own letters are read. I think the habit they
have on the stage of reading letters aloud to each other is such
a very delightful one. [<span class="smcap">Richard</span>, <i>with a smile and a shrug,
has opened his letter while</i> <span class="smcap">Clifton</span> <i>is talking.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. Good Lord!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. Dick, what is it?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span> [<i>reading</i>]. "199, Lincoln's Inn Fields. Dear
Sir, I have the pleasure to inform you that under the will of
the late Mr. Antony Clifton you are a beneficiary to the extent
of £50,000."</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. Dick!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. "A trifling condition is attached&mdash;namely, that
you should take the name of&mdash;Wurzel-Flummery." [<span class="smcap">Clifton</span>,
<i>with his hand on his heart, bows gracefully from one to the
other of them.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>annoyed</i>]. Impossible! Why should he leave
any money to you?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. Dick! How wonderful!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span> [<i>mildly</i>]. I don't remember ever having had a
morning quite like this.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span> [<i>angrily</i>]. Is this a joke, Mr. Clifton?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span>. Oh, the money is there all right. My clerk, a
man of the utmost&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. Then I refuse it. I'll have nothing to do with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page130" name="page130"></a>(p. 130)</span> it. I won't even argue about it. [<i>Tearing the letter into
bits.</i>] That's what I think of your money. [<i>He stalks indignantly
from the room.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. Dick! Oh, but, mother, he mustn't. Oh, I must
tell him&mdash;[<i>She hurries after him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Margaret</span> [<i>with dignity</i>]. Really, Mr. Clifton, I'm surprised
at you. [<i>She goes out too.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span> [<i>looking round the room</i>]. And now, Mr. Crawshaw,
we are alone.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. Yes. Well, I think, Mr. Clifton, you have
a good deal to explain&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span>. My dear sir, I'm longing to begin. I have been
looking forward to this day for weeks. I spent over an hour
this morning dressing for it. [<i>He takes papers from his hat
and moves to the sofa.</i>] Perhaps I had better begin from the
beginning.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>interested, indicating the papers</i>]. The documents
in the case?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span>. Oh dear, no&mdash;just something to carry in the hand.
It makes one look more like a solicitor. [<i>Reading the title.</i>]
"Watherston v. Towser&mdash;<i>in re</i> Great Missenden Canal Company."
My clerk invents the titles; it keeps him busy. He is
very fond of Towser; Towser is always coming in. [<i>Frankly.</i>]
You see, Mr. Crawshaw, this is my first real case, and I only
got it because Antony Clifton is my uncle. My efforts to introduce
a little picturesqueness into the dull formalities of the law
do not meet with that response that one would have expected.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>looking at his watch</i>]. Yes. Well, I'm a busy
man, and if you could tell me as shortly as possible why your
uncle left this money to me, and apparently to Mr. Meriton
too, under these extraordinary conditions, I shall be obliged
to you.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span>. Say no more, Mr. Crawshaw; I look forward to
being entirely frank with you. It will be a pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. You understand, of course, my position. I
think I may say that I am not without reputation in the country;
and proud as I am to accept this sacred trust, this money
which the late Mr. Antony Clifton has seen fit&mdash;[<i>modestly</i>]
one cannot say why&mdash;to bequeath to me, yet the use of the name
Wurzel-Flummery would be excessively awkward.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span> [<i>cheerfully</i>]. Excessively.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page131" name="page131"></a>(p. 131)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. My object in seeing you was to inquire if it
was absolutely essential that the name should go with the
money.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span>. Well [<i>thoughtfully</i>], you may have the name
<i>without</i> the money if you like. But you must have the name.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>disappointed</i>]. Ah! [<i>Bravely.</i>] Of course,
I have nothing against the name, a good old Hampshire name&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span> [<i>shocked</i>]. My dear Mr. Crawshaw, you didn't
think&mdash;you didn't really think that anybody had been called
Wurzel-Flummery before? Oh no, no. You and Mr. Meriton
were to be the first, the founders of the clan, the designers of
the Wurzel-Flummery sporran&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. What do you mean, sir? Are you telling me
that it is not a real name at all?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span>. Oh, it's a name all right. I know it is because&mdash;er&mdash;<i>I</i>
made it up.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>outraged</i>]. And you have the impudence to
propose, sir, that I should take a made-up name?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span> [<i>soothingly</i>]. Well, all names are made up some
time or other. Somebody had to think of&mdash;Adam.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. I warn you, Mr. Clifton, that I do not allow
this trifling with serious subjects.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span>. It's all so simple, really.... You see, my
Uncle Antony was a rather unusual man. He despised money.
He was not afraid to put it in its proper place. The place he
put it in was&mdash;er&mdash;a little below golf and a little above classical
concerts. If a man said to him, "Would you like to make fifty
thousand this afternoon?" he would say&mdash;well, it would depend
what he was doing. If he were going to have a round
at Walton Heath&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. It's perfectly scandalous to talk of money in
this way.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span>. Well, that's how he talked about it. But he
didn't find many to agree with him. In fact, he used to say
that there was nothing, however contemptible, that a man
would not do for money. One day I suggested that if he left
a legacy with a sufficiently foolish name attached to it, somebody
might be found to refuse it. He laughed at the idea.
That put me on my mettle. "Two people," I said; "leave
the same silly name to two people, two well-known people,
rival politicians, say, men whose own names are already public
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page132" name="page132"></a>(p. 132)</span> property. Surely they wouldn't both take it." That touched
him. "Denis, my boy, you've got it," he said. "Upon what
vile bodies shall we experiment?" We decided on you and
Mr. Meriton. The next thing was to choose the name. I
started on the wrong lines. I began by suggesting names like
Porker, Tosh, Bugge, Spiffkins&mdash;the obvious sort. My uncle&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>boiling with indignation</i>]. How <i>dare</i> you discuss
me with your uncle, sir! How dare you decide in this
cold-blooded way whether I am to be called&mdash;ah&mdash;Tosh&mdash;or-ah&mdash;Porker!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span>. My uncle wouldn't hear of Tosh or Porker. He
wanted a humorous name&mdash;a name he could roll lovingly round
his tongue&mdash;a name expressing a sort of humorous contempt&mdash;Wurzel-Flummery!
I can see now the happy ruminating smile
which came so often on my Uncle Antony's face in those latter
months. He was thinking of his two Wurzel-Flummeries. I
remember him saying once&mdash;it was at the Zoo&mdash;what a pity
it was he hadn't enough to divide among the whole Cabinet.
A whole bunch of Wurzel-Flummeries; it would have been
rather jolly.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. You force me to say, sir, that if <i>that</i> was the
way you and your uncle used to talk together at the Zoo, his
death can only be described as a merciful intervention of Providence.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span>. Oh, but I think he must be enjoying all this
somewhere, you know. I hope he is. He would have loved
this morning. It was his one regret that from the necessities
of the case he could not live to enjoy his own joke; but he had
hopes that echoes of it would reach him wherever he might be.
It was with some such idea, I fancy, that toward the end he
became interested in spiritualism.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>rising solemnly</i>]. Mr. Clifton, I have no interest
in the present whereabouts of your uncle, nor in what
means he has of overhearing a private conversation between you
and myself. But if, as you irreverently suggest, he is listening
to us, I should like him to hear this. That, in my opinion, you
are not a qualified solicitor at all, that you never had an uncle,
and that the whole story of the will and the ridiculous condition
attached to it is just the tomfool joke of a man who, by
his own admission, wastes most of his time writing unsuccessful
farces. And I propose&mdash;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page133" name="page133"></a>(p. 133)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span>. Pardon my interrupting. But you said farces.
Not farces, comedies&mdash;of a whimsical nature.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. Whatever they were, sir, I propose to report
the whole matter to the Law Society. And you know your way
out, sir.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span>. Then I am to understand that you refuse the
legacy, Mr. Crawshaw?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>startled</i>]. What's that?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span>. I am to understand that you refuse the fifty thousand
pounds?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. If the money is really there, I most certainly
do not refuse it.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span>. Oh, the money is most certainly there&mdash;and the
name. Both waiting for you.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>thumping the table</i>]. Then, sir, I accept them.
I feel it my duty to accept them, as a public expression of confidence
in the late Mr. Clifton's motives. I repudiate entirely
the motives that you have suggested to him, and I consider it
a sacred duty to show what I think of your story by accepting
the trust which he has bequeathed to me. You will arrange
further matters with my solicitor. Good-morning, sir.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span> [<i>to himself as he rises</i>]. Mr. Crawshaw here drank
a glass of water. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Crawshaw.</span>] Mr. Wurzel-Flummery,
farewell. May I express the parting wish that your future
career will add fresh luster to&mdash;my name. [<i>To himself as he
goes out.</i>] Exit Mr. Denis Clifton with dignity. [<i>But he has
left his papers behind him.</i> <span class="smcap">Crawshaw</span>, <i>walking indignantly
back to the sofa, sees the papers and picks them up.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>contemptuously</i>]. "Watherston v. Towser&mdash;<i>in
re</i> Great Missenden Canal Company." Bah! [<i>He tears
them up and throws them into the fire. He goes back to his
writing-table and is seated there as</i> <span class="smcap">Viola</span>, <i>followed by</i>
<span class="smcap">Meriton</span>, <i>comes in.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. Father, Dick doesn't want to take the money, but
I have told him that of course he must. He must, mustn't he?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. We needn't drag Robert into it, Viola.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. If Richard has the very natural feeling that
it would be awkward for me if there were two Wurzel-Flummeries
in the House of Commons, I should be the last to
interfere with his decision. In any case, I don't see what concern
it is of yours, Viola.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page134" name="page134"></a>(p. 134)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span> [<i>surprised</i>]. But how can we get married if he
doesn't take the money?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>hardly understanding</i>]. Married? What does
this mean, Richard?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. I'm sorry it has come out like this. We ought
to have told you before, but anyhow we were going to have told
you in a day or two. Viola and I want to get married.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. And what did you want to get married on?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span> [<i>with a smile</i>]. Not very much, I'm afraid.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. We're all right now, father, because we shall have
fifty thousand pounds.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span> [<i>sadly</i>]. Oh, Viola, Viola!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. But naturally this puts a very different complexion
on matters.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. So of course he must take it, mustn't he, father?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. I can hardly suppose, Richard, that you expect
me to entrust my daughter to a man who is so little provident
for himself that he throws away fifty thousand pounds because
of some fanciful objection to the name which goes
with it.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span> [<i>in despair</i>]. You don't understand, Robert.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. I understand this, Richard. That if the name
is good enough for me, it should be good enough for you. You
don't mind asking Viola to take <i>your</i> name, but you consider
it an insult if you are asked to take <i>my</i> name.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. Well, I'm going to be Miss Wurzel-Flummery anyhow,
darling.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span> [<i>beaten</i>]. Heaven help me! you'll make me take
it. But you'll never understand.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span> [<i>stopping to administer comfort to him on his

I understand perfectly. All that you were saying about
money a little while ago&mdash;it's all perfectly true, it's all just
what I feel myself. But in practice we have to make allowances
sometimes. We have to sacrifice our ideals for&mdash;ah&mdash;others.
I shall be very proud to have you for a son-in-law,
and to feel that there will be the two of us in Parliament together
upholding the honor of the&mdash;ah&mdash;name. And perhaps
now that we are to be so closely related, you may come to feel
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page135" name="page135"></a>(p. 135)</span> some day that your views could be&mdash;ah&mdash;more adequately put
forward from <i>my</i> side of the House.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. Go on, Robert; I deserve it.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Crawshaw</span>. Well, well! Margaret will be interested in
our news. And you must send that solicitor a line&mdash;or perhaps
a telephone message would be better. [<i>He goes to the
door and turns round just as he is going out.</i>] Yes, I think
the telephone, Richard; it would be safer. [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span> [<i>holding out his hands to</i> <span class="smcap">Viola</span>]. Come here,
Mrs. Wurzel-Flummery.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. Not Mrs. Wurzel-Flummery; Mrs. Dick. And
soon, please, darling. [<i>She comes to him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span> [<i>shaking his head sadly at her</i>]. I don't know
what I've done, Viola. [<i>Suddenly.</i>] But you're worth it. [<i>He

if I ever stop thinking so!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span> [<i>to himself</i>]. Now where did I put those papers?
[<i>He hums to himself again.</i>] Now where&mdash;oh, I beg your
pardon! I left some papers behind.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. Dick, you'll tell him. [<i>As she goes out, she says to</i>
<span class="smcap">Clifton</span>.] Good-by, Mr. Clifton, and thank you for writing
such nice letters.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span>. Good-by, Miss Crawshaw.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span>. Just say it to see how it sounds.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span>. Good-by, Miss Wurzel-Flummery.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Viola</span> [<i>smiling happily</i>]. No, not Miss, Mrs. [<i>She goes
out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span> [<i>looking in surprise from her to him</i>]. You don't
mean&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. Yes; and I'm taking the money after all, Mr.
Clifton.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span>. Dear me, what a situation! [<i>Thoughtfully to
himself.</i>] I wonder how a rough scenario would strike the
managers.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. Poor Mr. Clifton!</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page136" name="page136"></a>(p. 136)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span>. Why poor?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. You missed all the best part. You didn't hear
what I said to Crawshaw about money before you came.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span> [<i>thoughtfully</i>]. Oh! was it very&mdash;[<i>Brightening

Well, I must be getting on. I wonder if you've noticed any
important papers lying about, in connection with the Great
Missenden Canal Company&mdash;a most intricate case, in which my
clerk and I&mdash;[<i>He has murmured himself across to the fireplace,

his eye. He picks up one of the fragments.</i>] Ah, yes. Well,
I shall tell my clerk that we lost the case. He will be sorry.
He had got quite fond of that canal. [<i>He turns to go, but

Meriton?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span>. And Mr. Crawshaw too?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Richard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Clifton</span> [<i>to himself as he goes out</i>]. They are both taking

HAROLD BRIGHOUSE</h1>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page139" name="page139"></a>(p. 139)</span> Miss Horniman could hardly have foreseen the development
of a Manchester school of dramatists as the outcome of her
experiment with repertory at the Gaiety Theatre in Manchester,
because her purpose was to produce good plays irrespective
of geographical limitations. But the fact is that the
project was a source of real inspiration to a group of young
Lancashire writers among whom may be mentioned Allan
Broome, Stanley Houghton, and Harold Brighouse. There is
no plainer illustration of the relations between the audience and
the play, or between the theatre and the play, or between the
actor and the play than the dramatic activity that followed the
establishment of the Abbey Theatre in Dublin and the setting
up of Miss Horniman's experiment in Manchester.</p>

<p>Although in this collection, Brighouse is represented by <i>Maid
of France</i>, a play with no local Lancashire coloring, first given
on July 16, 1917, in London, not Manchester (it was later
produced at the Greenwich Village Theatre in New York, beginning
April 18, 1918), he has up to the present time written
seven plays about Lancashire. He has been particularly successful
in one-act drama; <i>Lonesome Like</i>, <i>The Price of Coal</i>,
and <i>Spring in Bloomsbury</i> have been popular here and in England.
B. Iden Payne, who directed productions at the Gaiety
Theatre for some time, says: "In all Harold Brighouse's plays
there is in the acting more laughter than one would expect from
the reading." A number of Brighouse's plays have been published;
in the introduction to the latest volume,<a id="footnotetag36" name="footnotetag36"></a><a href="#footnote36" title="Go to footnote 36"><span class="smaller">[36]</span></a> he writes:
"In another age than ours play-books were a favorite, if not
the only form of light reading.... The reader mentally
producing a play from the book in his hand looks through a
magic casement at what he gloriously will instead of through
a proscenium arch at the handiwork of a mere human producer."
This playwright's attitude toward the reading of plays,
with its appeal to the imagination, is one justification for a
collection like the present one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page140" name="page140"></a>(p. 140)</span> Brighouse is himself a Manchester man, having been born in
Eccles, a suburb, on July 26, 1882. He was educated at the
Manchester Grammar School. Until 1913 he was engaged in
business, carrying on his literary work at the same time, but
in that year he gave himself up exclusively to writing. Besides
plays, he has written fiction and criticism. During the
Great War, he was attached to the Intelligence Staff of the
Air Ministry.</p>

<p class="opening"><span class="min10pc"><span class="smcap">The Scene</span> <i>represents one side of a square in a French town
on Christmas Eve, 1916. The buildings shown have suffered
from German shells, except the church in the center
which stands immune, protected, as it were, by the statue
of Jeanne d'Arc which stands on a pedestal, surrounded by
steps in front of it. The church is lighted up within for
the midnight mass, but it is its side which presents itself to
one's view, so that the ingoing worshipers are not seen.
The statue is of the Maid in her armor. It is nearly midnight
on Christmas Eve and the lighting, which should not
be too realistically obscure, suggests faint moonlight.</i></span></p>

<p class="opening"><span class="min10pc"><span class="smcap">Paul</span>, <i>a French private in war-worn uniform, stands by the
steps, gazing adoringly at the statue. He is a charmingly
simple, credulous man, in peace a peasant. To him there
enters from the right,</i> <span class="smcap">Blanche</span>, <i>a flower-girl, in a cloak,
with a basket of flowers. In face and figure,</i> <span class="smcap">Blanche</span>
<i>must resemble the statue. She is a pert, impudent, extremely
self-possessed saleswoman, burning, however, with
the fierce light of French patriotism which, almost in spite
of herself, is apt to get the better of her. Ready as she
is to trade upon</i> <span class="smcap">Paul's</span> <i>mystic reverence for the Maid,
familiarity with the statue has not bred contempt in her.
She stops by</i> <span class="smcap">Paul</span>, <i>offering her flowers with a cajoling
smile.</i></span></p>

<div class="gettys">
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span>. Will you buy a flower, monsieur?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. Flower, mademoiselle? You can sell flowers at this
hour when it is nearly midnight?</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page142" name="page142"></a>(p. 142)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span>. There is moonlight, and I have a smile, monsieur.
It is my smile which sells the flowers. Does not monsieur agree
that it is irresistible?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span> [<i>uneasily</i>]. Mademoiselle has charm.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span>. And I have charms for you. My flowers. Will
you not buy a flower, monsieur, and I will pin it to your uniform
where it will draw all the ladies' eyes to you when you
promenade on the boulevard?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. I do not promenade. I stay here.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span>. Here in the Square where it is dull and
lonely? But on the boulevards are lights, monsieur, and
gaiety, and people promenade because to-night is Christmas
Eve.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. Mademoiselle, you're kind. Will you be kind to
me and tell me something?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span>. What can I tell?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. I am only a peasant and I do not know many things.
But you live in the town and you must know. They say, mademoiselle,
they have told me, that there are miracles on Christmas
Eve.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span>. Did you believe them?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. I did not know. I only hoped.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span>. What did you hope?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span> [<i>very earnestly</i>]. I have been told that stone can speak
on Christmas Eve. And I want, oh, mademoiselle, I want to
hear the blessed voice of our glorious Maid.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span>. Monsieur has sentiment.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span> [<i>pleadingly</i>]. You think that she will speak to me?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span> [<i>dropping all banter</i>]. Monsieur, she speaks in
stone to all of us. She stands erect, serene, like the unconquerable
spirit of France and cries defiance at the Boche. They
sent their shells like hail and ground our homes to powder and
made a desolation of our streets, but they could not touch the
statue of the Maid nor the church she guards.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. And she speaks! She speaks!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span>. She is the soul of France, monsieur, defying
tyranny, invincible and unafraid. She is a message to each one
of us. As the shells fell all around and could not harm her,
so must we stand unshaken for the France we love. She speaks
of freedom and deliverance.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. And she will speak to me?</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page143" name="page143"></a>(p. 143)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span> [<i>pityingly as she sees how literally he has taken
her</i>]. Perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. What must I do, mademoiselle, to hear her voice?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span> [<i>seeing in this too good an opportunity for selling
a flower</i>]. Will you not buy a flower for the Maid? They
come from far away, from the South where there is always
sun, and so they are not cheap. But, for a franc, you may have
one lily of Lorraine to put upon the statue of the Maid.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. A lily of Lorraine!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span> [<i>showing a flower, then taking it back tantalizingly</i>].
See, monsieur! How could she refuse to speak to you
if you gave her that?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. It is the way to make her speak! [<i>Puts out hand
for the flower and then draws back.</i> ] But a franc! And I
have nothing but one sou.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span>. One sou! When flowers are so dear, and have
to come so far! Mon dieu, monsieur, but you have had a
thirsty day if a sou is all that you have left from the wineshops.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. I did not spend it there, mademoiselle. I gave it
to the church, this church where is the statue of our Maid.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span> [<i>only half scoffing</i>]. Monsieur is devout.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. Not always, mademoiselle. But I was born at
Domremy where she was born and I have always adored our
sainted Maid who died for France. Perhaps because of that,
perhaps without the flower, Jeanne will speak to me at midnight
when they say the statues come to life.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span> [<i>touched</i>]. Monsieur, I do not know. Perhaps
she will. But see, here is a lily of Lorraine which I give you
for the Maid. Put it upon her statue and perhaps it will
awaken her to speech.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. Mademoiselle! [<i>Taking the flower.</i>] How can I
thank you?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span>. I also am a maid of France, monsieur. You are
a soldier and you fight for France. But I must sell my flowers
now. Perhaps, when I have sold them, I will come again to
see if Jeanne has spoken.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. You think she will?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span>. Monsieur, have faith. All things are possible
on Christmas Eve. [<i>She moves L.</i> <span class="smcap">Paul</span> <i>goes to the statue and
puts the lily on its breast.</i>]</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page144" name="page144"></a>(p. 144)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span>. Holy Virgin, the lies I've told! What simplicity!
But Jeanne might. She might. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Blanche</span> <i>L.</i>
<span class="smcap">Paul</span> <i>stands, watching. An English lieutenant,</i> <span class="smcap">Gerald
Soames</span>, <i>enters R., carrying a small wreath of evergreens. He
is awkward and self-conscious and stops short when he sees</i>
<span class="smcap">Paul</span>, <i>annoyed in the English way at being found out in an
act of sentiment. By consequence, the little ceremony he had
proposed falls short of the impressiveness he designed for it.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Gerald</span>. O Lord, there's a fellow there. Er&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Paul</span>
<i>salutes.</i>] Oh&mdash;er&mdash;c'est ici la statue de Jeanne d'Arc, n'est-ce
pas?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. Mais oui, monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Gerald</span>. And that's about as far as my French will go. I
say, you're not on duty, are you? Vous n'êtes pas de garde?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. Non, monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Gerald</span>. No, of course you're not. Damned silly question
to ask. All the same, I wish he'd take a hint. I say. Lord,
I've forgotten the French for "have a drink." Besides, he
couldn't. It's too late. I'll just do what I came for and go.
[<i>Puts back into pocket the coin he had taken out.</i>] After all,
the fellow's as good a right to be here as I have. I'll have one
more shot. N'avez-vous pas des affaires?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. Mais non, monsieur. Pas ce soir. Je suis en congé.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Gerald</span>. Heaven knows what that means, except that he's
a fixture. Oh well, I don't care if he does see me. He'll not
know what to make of it, anyhow. [<i>Up to statue.</i>] Jeanne
d'Arc, I'm putting this wreath on your statue. It's an English
wreath and it came from England. It's English holly and
English ivy and it's supposed to mean that England's sorry for
the awful things she did to you and I hope you've forgiven us
all. [<i>He has cap off. Now puts cap on.</i>] I think that's all.
[<i>Places wreath at statue's feet. Stands erect, salutes, turns.</i>]
Hang that French fellow. I suppose he'll think I'm mad.
[<span class="smcap">Gerald</span> <i>goes down steps and off R.</i> <span class="smcap">Paul</span> <i>salutes, then goes
up steps to look at the wreath.</i> <span class="smcap">Fred Colledge</span>, <i>an English
private, enters L. Without noticing</i> <span class="smcap">Paul</span>, <i>he sits on the steps
and lights a cigarette. In the light of his match he sees</i> <span class="smcap">Paul</span>,
<i>gives a little amused laugh and lies back making himself comfortable,
turning up coat-collar, etc.</i> <span class="smcap">Paul</span> <i>sees him, and is
shocked. Comes down steps.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. Monsieur!</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page145" name="page145"></a>(p. 145)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Hullo, cockey. How are you getting on?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. Monsieur! This place. These steps. One does not
rest upon these steps.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Ho yes, one does. I'm doing it, so I ought to
know.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. But here, monsieur. Outside the church.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. That's all right. The better the place the better the
seat. It ain't a feather-bed in the old house at home, but I've
sort of lost the feather-bed 'abit lately.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. One should not sit on these steps, monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. You must like that tune, old son, the way you stick
to it. And, if you ask me, one should not do a pile of things
that one's been doing over here. Take me, now. By rights, I
ought to be eating roast beef and plum-pudding to-morrow in
Every Street. Third turn on the left below the Mile End
Pavilion, but I suppose I'm the same way as you. Going back
on the train at 2 <span class="smcap">A.M</span>. to eat my Christmas dinner in the blooming
trenches. That's you, ain't it? And it's me, too. So let's
sit down together and do an entente for an hour. Don't talk
and I'll race you to where the dreams come from. [<i>He pulls</i>
<span class="smcap">Paul</span> <i>down genially beside him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span> [<i>sitting</i>]. I ought not to sit here.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Ain't these steps soft enough for you?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. Monsieur, you do not understand. I come from
Domremy.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Do you? I'm Mile End myself. What about it?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. But Domremy.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Can't say I'm much the wiser.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. But here, monsieur. This statue. It is our glorious
maid. C'est Jeanne d'Arc.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Ark, eh? Is that old Noah? [<i>Gets up to look at
statue.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span> [<i>rising</i>]. Jeanne d'Arc, monsieur. She&mdash;

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Oh, it's a lady, is it? Dressed like that for riding,
I reckon. So that's old Noah's wife, is it? Well, the old cock
had a bit of taste.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. It is Jeanne d'Arc. You call her&mdash;what do you call
her?&mdash;Joan of&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Not guilty. I ain't so forward with the ladies. I
don't call them in their Christian names till I've been introduced.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page146" name="page146"></a>(p. 146)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. You English call her Joan of Arc. The great Jeanne
d'Arc. She&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Wait a bit. Now don't excite me for a moment.
I'm thinking. I've heard that name before.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. But yes, monsieur. In history.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. That's done it. I take you, cockey. I knew it was
a way back. Well, she's nothing in my life. [<i>Returns to steps
and sits.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. She is of my life. I come from Domremy.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. So you said.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. It was her birthplace.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span> [<i>clapping him on the shoulder</i>]. Cockey, I'm with you
now. I know the feeling. Why, we'd a man born in our
street that played center-forward for the Arsenal. Makes you
proud of the place where you were born. Na pooed now, poor
devil. Got his head blown off last month. He was a sergeant
in our lot. 'Ave a woodbine?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. Not here, monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Please yourself. Smoke your own. Them black
things are no use to me. It's a rum country yours, old son.
Light beer and black tobacco. But you fight on it all right.
Oh yes, you fight all right. 'Ere, 'ave a piece of chocolate to
keep the cold out. My missus sent me that.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span> [<i>accepting</i>]. Merci. I hope madame is well.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Eh? Who's madame? Oh, you mean old Sally.
She's all right. In bed. That's where she is. And I'm here.
But I could do with a bit of a snooze myself. Come on, let's
do a doss together.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. A doss?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Yus. Wait a bit. I speak French when I'm 'appy.
Je vais dormir. Vous likewise dormir.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. I did not come to sleep, monsieur. I came to watch.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Watch? What do you want to watch for here? No
Germans here.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. C'est la nuit de Noël, monsieur. They say the statues
come to life on Christmas Eve, and I am watching here to
see if Jeanne will breathe and move and speak to a piou-piou
from Domremy.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. You know, old son, you could have scared me once
with a tale like that. But not to-day. I've been seeing life
lately. If old Nelson got down off his perch, and I met him
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page147" name="page147"></a>(p. 147)</span> walking in Trafalgar Square, I'd just salute and think no more
about it. You can't raise my hair now.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. Then you believe that she will speak?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. You go to sleep, cockey, and there's no knowing what
you'll hear. Come on, old sport. Je dormir and vous dormir,
and we'll be a blooming dormitory. [<span class="smcap">Paul</span> <i>hesitates, looks at
statue, then lies by</i> <span class="smcap">Fred</span>.] That's right. Lie close. Two can
keep warmer than one. Oh well, good-night all. Merry
Christmas, and to hell with the Kaiser. [<i>They sleep. The
statue is darkened, and the lay figure of the statue is replaced
by the living</i> <span class="smcap">Jeanne</span>. <i>Bells chime midnight. As they begin,</i>
<span class="smcap">Jeanne</span> <i>awakes. With the first chime, light shines dimly on
the statue. By the last chime, the statue is in brilliant light and</i>
<span class="smcap">Jeanne</span> <i>stirs on the pedestal and bends to the wreath. She
lifts it, wondering.</i></p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jeanne</span>. The wreath is here. I did not dream it, then. I
saw him come and lay the wreath at my feet. I saw his uniform,
and the uniform was not of France. I saw his face, and
it was not a Frenchman's face. I heard his voice, and the voice
was an English voice. I do not understand. Why should the
English bring a wreath to me? I do not want their wreath.
I want no favors from an Englishman. I am Jeanne d'Arc.
I am your enemy, you English, whom I made to bite the dust
at Orléans and vanquished at Patay. It was I who bore the
standard into the cathedral at Rheims when we crowned my
Dauphin the anointed King of France, and English Bedford
trembled at my name. Burgundians took me at Compiègne.
Your English money bought me from them, and your English
hatred gave me up to mocking priests to try for sorcery. You
called me "Heretic," "Relapsed," "Apostate," and "Idolater,"
and burnt me for a witch in Rouen market-place. And now do
you lay a wreath at Jeanne's feet? And do you think she
thanks you? I scorn your wreath. This wreath an English
soldier set at Jeanne's feet. I tear it, and I trample on it.
[<span class="smcap">Fred</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Paul</span> <i>have awakened during this speech. Both are
bewildered at first, like men who dream. But as</i> <span class="smcap">Jeanne</span> <i>is
about to tear the wreath</i> <span class="smcap">Fred</span> <i>interposes.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. I dunno if I'm awake or asleep, but that there wreath,
lady&mdash;I say, don't tear it. I don't know nothing about it bar
what you've just said, but if any of our blokes put it there, you
can take it from me it was kindly meant.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page148" name="page148"></a>(p. 148)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jeanne</span>. You? Who are you? You're&mdash;You're English.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span> [<i>apologetically</i>]. Yus. I'm English. I don't see that
I can help it, though. I just happen to be English same as a
dawg. I'm sorry if it upsets you, but I'm English all right.
And&mdash;No. Blimey, I won't apologize for it. I'm English.
I'm English, and proud of it. So there!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jeanne</span>. Why are the English here in France? Why do I
see so many of them?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. Maid&mdash;Jeanne&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jeanne</span>. You! You are not English. You are a soldier
of France.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. I am of France.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jeanne</span>. Then shame to you, soldier of France! Shame
on a Frenchman who can forget his pride of race and make a
comrade of an Englishman!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. Maid, you do not understand.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jeanne</span>. No. I do not understand. I do not understand
treachery. I do not understand baseness, dishonor, and the
perfidy of one who has forgotten he is French. The English
are the foes of France, and you consort with them. You&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. 'Ere, 'ere, 'alf a mo'. Steady on, lady. You've got
to learn something. All that stuff you've just been talking
about the Battle of Waterloo. It's a wash-out now. We've
cut it out. This 'ere bloke you're grousing at 'e's a friend of
mine, and I'll pipe up for a friend when 'e's being reprimanded
undeserving.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jeanne</span>. It is for that I blame a son of France, that he
makes friends with you.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Well, it's your mistake. That's the worst of coming
out of history. You're out of date. If I took my great-grandmother
on a motor-bus to a picture-show, she'd have the
same sort of fit that you've got, only it's worse with you.
You're further back. And I'll tell you something. That old
French froggy business is dead and gorn. We've given it up.
Time's passed when an Englishman thought he could lick two
Frenchmen with one hand tied behind his back. It's a back
number, lady. Carpentier put the lid on that. You ask Billy
Wells. Us blokes and the French, we're feeding out of one
another's hands to-day.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jeanne</span>. I have seen the English and the French together
in the streets. They do not fight.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page149" name="page149"></a>(p. 149)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Lord bless you, no. Provost-marshal wouldn't let
'em, if they wanted a friendly scrap.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jeanne</span>. They fraternize. I have seen them walking arm-in-arm.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. That's natural enough.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jeanne</span>. Natural, for French and English!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Yes, lady, natural. If you'd seen the Frenchies fighting,
same as I have, you'd want to walk arm-in-arm with them
yourself, and be proud to do it, too.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. The English, are our brothers, Maid.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Gorlummy, we're more than that. I've known
brothers do the dirty on each other. Us and the French, we're&mdash;why,
we're <i>pals</i>. So that's all right, lady. Just let me put
that wreath back where you got it from. I'm sure you'll 'urt
someone's feelings if you trample on it. [<i>He tries to take
wreath, she prevents him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jeanne</span>. When you have shown me why I should accept
an English wreath, perhaps I will. So far I've yet to
learn why a soldier of France is friendly with an Englishman.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. I can't show you more than this, can I? [<i>Links arms
with</i> <span class="smcap">Paul</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jeanne</span>. That is not reason.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span> [<i>unlinking his arm</i>]. Perhaps I can show you reason.
I who was born at Domremy.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jeanne</span>. You come from there! My home?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jeanne</span>. You know St. Remy's church and the Meuse and
the beech-tree where they said the fairies used to dance. The
tree. Is it still there?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. I do not know.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jeanne</span>. And the fields! The fields where I kept my
father's sheep, and the wolves would not come near when I
had charge of them, and the birds came to me and ate bread
from my lap. You know those fields of Domremy?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. I knew them once.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jeanne</span>. You knew my church. It still is there?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. Who can say?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jeanne</span>. Cannot you, who were baptized in it?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. Jeanne, the Germans came to Domremy. I do not
know if anything is left.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page150" name="page150"></a>(p. 150)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jeanne</span>. The Germans? But the Germans did not count
when I lived there.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. No, and they'll count a sight less before so long.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. They came like a thunderstorm, Jeanne. They
swept our men away. They tore up treaties, and they came
through Belgium and ravished it, and took us unawares. They
blotted out our frontiers and came on like the tide till even
Paris heard the sound of German guns. And then the English
came, slowly at first, and just a little late, but not too late,
then more and more and all the time more English came. They
swept the Germans from the seas and drove their ships to hide.
Shoulder to shoulder they have fought for France. They hurled
the Germans back from Paris, and when their soldiers fell more
came and more. Their plowmen and their clerks, their great
lords and their scullions, all came to France to fight with us
for la patrie. Their women make munitions and&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Yus. I daresay. Very fine. Only that'll do. We
ain't done nothing to make a song about.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. Our children and our children's children will make
songs of what the English did.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. You let 'em. Leave it to 'em. Way I look at it is
this, lady. There's a big swelled-headed bully, and he gets a
little fellow down and starts kicking 'im. Well, it ain't manners,
and we blokes comes along to teach 'im wot's wot. That's
all there is to it.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. There's more than I could tell in a hundred years,
Jeanne.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Then what's the good of trying?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jeanne</span>. He tried because he had to make me understand
your friendship and all the noble thought and noble deed that
lie behind this little wreath. [<i>She raises the wreath.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span> [<i>interposing</i>]. Oh, I say now, lady, go easy with that
wreath, won't you? I&mdash;I wouldn't trample it if I were you.
Battle of Waterloo's a long time ago.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jeanne</span>. Don't be afraid.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Gave me a turn to see you pick it up like that.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jeanne</span> [<i>putting it on her head</i>]. The English wreath is
in its right place now. Here, on the head of Jeanne d'Arc.
I'll wear that wreath forever. Give me your hand, you English
soldier.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. I've not washed since morning, lady.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page151" name="page151"></a>(p. 151)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jeanne</span>. Your hand, that fights for France. [<i>She takes it.</i>]
And yours, soldier of France.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. Jeanne! But you&mdash;[<i>Holding back timidly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jeanne</span>. I am where I would always be&mdash;[<i>she has a hand
of both</i>]&mdash;amongst my fighting men. They have set me on a
pedestal and made a saint of me, but I am better here, between
you two, both soldiers of France. They will not let me fight
for France to-day. Save for this mystic hour on Christmas Eve
I am a thing of stone. But Jeanne lives on. Her spirit fights
for France to-day as Jeanne fought five hundred years ago. And,
in this hour when I am granted speech, I say, "Fight on, fight
on for France till France and Belgium are free and the invader
pays the price of treachery. And you, you English who have
come to France, and you in England who are making arms for
France, I, who have hated you, I, whom you burnt, I, Jeanne
d'Arc of Rheims and Orléans, I give you thanks. My people
are your people, and my cause your cause. Vivent! Vivent
les Anglais!" [<i>During this speech she drops the soldiers'
hands. They resume gradually their sleeping attitudes.</i> <span class="smcap">Jeanne</span>
<i>mounts her pedestal, and gives the last words from it, then
becomes stone again. The light fades to darkness, then becomes
the moonlight of the opening.</i> <span class="smcap">Blanche</span> <i>enters L. She
goes to the steps, looks at the sleeping soldiers, and stands above
them. Her basket is empty but for one flower.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span> [<i>stirring and seeing her</i>]. Jeanne!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span>. My name is Blanche, monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. But I&mdash;you&mdash;[<i>he rises</i>]. Mademoiselle, you are
very like&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span>. I am the flower-girl whom you saw before you
went to sleep, and I am very like myself, monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. Was I asleep? [<i>Looks at statue.</i>] Yes. There is
Jeanne.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span>. Where else should Jeanne be but on her
pedestal?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span> [<i>stirring</i>]. Revelley again before you've hardly closed
your blooming eyes. [<i>Sits up sharply on seeing</i> <span class="smcap">Blanche</span>.]
Hullo! You're&mdash;you're&mdash;[<i>Turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Paul</span>.] Why, cockey,
it wasn't a yarn. The statues do walk about in France.
There's one of them doing it.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. You saw her too?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Saw her? Of course I seen her. She's there. Ain't
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page152" name="page152"></a>(p. 152)</span> you and me been talking familiar with her for the last ten
minutes?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. Yes, with Jeanne.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Took my 'and she did, and chanced the dirt.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span>. You have been dreaming, monsieur. C'était une
rêverie.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Who's raving? Well, it may be raving, but we all
raved together. You and me and 'im, and I'll eat my bayonet
raw if you didn't stand there and take us by the hands and
tell us you were that there Joan of Arc what used to tell old
Bonaparte what to do when he was in an 'ole.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span>. It was not I. There is the statue, monsieur.
[<i>Points to it.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Where? [<i>Looks.</i>] Well, that's queer. You're the
dead spit and image of 'er, too. And 'ere, 'ere, cockey! [<i>Takes</i>
<span class="smcap">Paul's</span> <i>arm excitedly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. Monsieur?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Look at the statue. Look at its head. Who put that
wreath on it? Did you climb up there?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. No. You know you didn't. We saw her put it on
herself.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. But, monsieur, then you have dreamed the same
dream as I.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. I saw you all right, and you saw me?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. I saw you.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. And we both saw 'er. It's a rum go, cockey, but I
told you I'd given up being surprised. Our lot and yours we're
going whacks in licking the Germans, ain't we? Yus, and now
we're going whacks in the same dream, so that's that and chance
it. Ententing again, only extra cordial. [<i>Scratches head.</i>] I
don't quite see where she comes in, though, if she ain't the statue.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span>. I am a flower-girl, monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Not so many flowers about you, then.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span>. I have sold out, all but one flower, monsieur,
and I came back to see if you [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Paul</span>] had got your wish.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. Yes, mademoiselle, I had my wish. The saints sent
Jeanne to me in a dream.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span>. You happy man, to get your wish!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Paul</span>. I am happy, mademoiselle. I have spoken with
Jeanne d'Arc.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page153" name="page153"></a>(p. 153)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. And you and me will be speaking with our sergeants
if we don't buck up and catch that blinking train. Come on,
old son, back to the Big Stink for us.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span>. Messieurs return to fight?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Lord love you, no. It's only a rumor about the war.
We're a Cook's excursion on a joy-ride seeing the sights of
France. [<span class="smcap">Fred</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Paul</span> <i>move R. together.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span>. Monsieur!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span> [<i>stopping</i>]. Well?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Blanche</span>. I kept one flower back. It is for you&mdash;for the
brave English soldier who goes out to fight for France.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Fred</span>. Don't make me homesick. Reminds me of the flower-pots

AUGUSTA GREGORY</h1>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page157" name="page157"></a>(p. 157)</span> Isabella Augusta Persse, later Lady Gregory, was born at
Roxborough, County Galway, Ireland, in 1859. One who saw
her in the early years of her married life describes her thus:
"She was then a young woman, very earnest, who divided her
hair in the middle and wore it smooth on either side of a broad
and handsome brow. Her eyes were always full of questions.
... In her drawing-room were to be met men of assured
reputation in literature and politics and there was always the
best reading of the times upon her tables."</p>

<p>Two closely related interests have always divided Lady
Gregory's attention. Her occupation with the Irish Players has
been constant, and she has from the beginning been a director
of the Abbey Theatre, where <i>Spreading the News</i> was first
performed on December 27, 1904. This play was also included
in the American repertory of the Players, whom Lady Gregory
accompanied on their visit to the United States in 1911. The
spirit that she puts into her work with them is well illustrated
by those lines of Blake which she quoted in a speech made
at a dinner given her by <i>The Outlook</i> when she was in
New York. Her hard work having been commented on, she
replied:</p>

<p class="poem20">
"I will not cease from mental strife<br>
Or let the sword fall from my hand<br>
Till we have built Jerusalem<br>
In&mdash;Ireland's&mdash;fair and lovely land."</p>

<p>In her book on <i>Our Irish Theatre, A Chapter of Autobiography</i>,
she relates the story of how one day when she assembled
the company for rehearsal in Washington, D. C., she invited
them to leave their work and come with her to Mount Vernon
for a holiday and picnic. "I told them," she writes, "the
holiday was not a precedent, for we might go to a great many
countries before finding so great a man to honor." Washington,
it seems, had been a friend of her grandfather's who had
been in America with his regiment.</p>

<p>Her other great interest has been the folklore of Ireland.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page158" name="page158"></a>(p. 158)</span> She has been called the Irish Malory, because through her retelling
of the Irish sagas, she has popularized and made accessible
the great cycles of heroic legends. She has employed for
the vernacular of these romances and folk tales what she calls
Kiltartan English, Kiltartan being the village near her home,
the dialect of which she has assimilated and utilized. Lady
Gregory has also used her historical and legendary knowledge
for the background of some of her plays.</p>

<p>It is said that the original impulse that influenced Lady
Gregory to interest herself in these old Irish stories came from
Yeats, her friend and associate in the project of the Irish National
Theatre. It was his suggestion in the first place that
led to her writing <i>Cuchulain of Muirthemne</i>. "He could not
have been long at Coole," writes George Moore of Yeats,
"before he began to draw her attention to the beauty of the
literature that rises among the hills and bubbles irresponsibly,
and set her going from cabin to cabin taking down stories, and
encouraging her to learn the original language of the country,
so that they might add to the Irish idiom which the peasant
had already translated into English, making in this way a language
for themselves." The influence continues, for her latest
book, <i>Visions and Beliefs in the West of Ireland</i>, contains two
essays and notes from the pen of Yeats.</p>

<p>The literary association of Yeats and Lady Gregory has been
a fruitful one for Ireland. Not only has Yeats encouraged
Lady Gregory's researches into the past, but she has been of
the greatest assistance to him in his work. When he is at
Coole, she writes from his dictation, arranges his manuscript,
reads to him and serves him as literary counselor.</p>

<p>Lady Gregory's life touches the life of Ireland at many
points. In addition to her literary occupations, she lectures and
co-operates actively with a number of societies that have as
their aim social or political betterment.</p>

<p class="opening"><span class="min10pc"><i>SCENE.</i>&mdash;<i>The outskirts of a Fair. An Apple Stall.</i>  <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Tarpey</span> <i>sitting at it.</i> <span class="smcap">Magistrate</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Policeman</span> <i>enter.</i></span></p>

<div class="gettys">
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. So that is the Fair Green. Cattle and sheep
and mud. No system. What a repulsive sight!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Policeman</span>. That is so, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. I suppose there is a good deal of disorder in
this place?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Policeman</span>. There is.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. Common assault?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Policeman</span>. It's common enough.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. Agrarian crime, no doubt?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Policeman</span>. That is so.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. Boycotting? Maiming of cattle? Firing
into houses?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Policeman</span>. There was one time, and there might be again.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. That is bad. Does it go any farther than
that?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Policeman</span>. Far enough, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. Homicide, then! This district has been
shamefully neglected! I will change all that. When I was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page160" name="page160"></a>(p. 160)</span> in the Andaman Islands, my system never failed. Yes, yes, I
will change all that. What has that woman on her stall?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Policeman</span>. Apples mostly&mdash;and sweets.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. Just see if there are any unlicensed goods
underneath&mdash;spirits or the like. We had evasions of the salt
tax in the Andaman Islands.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Policeman</span> [<i>sniffing cautiously and upsetting a heap of
apples</i>]. I see no spirits here&mdash;or salt.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span> [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Tarpey</span>]. Do you know this town
well, my good woman?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tarpey</span> [<i>holding out some apples</i>]. A penny the half-dozen,
your honor.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Policeman</span> [<i>shouting</i>]. The gentleman is asking do you
know the town! He's the new magistrate!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tarpey</span> [<i>rising and ducking</i>]. Do I know the town?
I do, to be sure.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span> [<i>shouting</i>]. What is its chief business?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tarpey</span>. Business, is it? What business would the
people here have but to be minding one another's business?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. I mean what trade have they?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tarpey</span>. Not a trade. No trade at all but to be
talking.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. I shall learn nothing here. [<span class="smcap">James Ryan</span>
<i>comes in, pipe in mouth. Seeing</i> <span class="smcap">Magistrate</span> <i>he retreats
quickly, taking pipe from mouth.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. The smoke from that man's pipe had a
greenish look; he may be growing unlicensed tobacco at home.
I wish I had brought my telescope to this district. Come to
the post-office, I will telegraph for it. I found it very useful
in the Andaman Islands. [<span class="smcap">Magistrate</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Policeman</span> <i>go
out left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tarpey</span>. Bad luck to Jo Muldoon, knocking my
apples this way and that way. [<i>Begins arranging them.</i>]
Showing off he was to the new magistrate. [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Bartley
Fallon</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Fallon</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. Indeed it's a poor country and a scarce country
to be living in. But I'm thinking if I went to America it's
long ago the day I'd be dead!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Fallon</span>. So you might, indeed. [<i>She puts her
basket on a barrel and begins putting parcels in it, taking
them from under her cloak.</i>]</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page161" name="page161"></a>(p. 161)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. And it's a great expense for a poor man to be
buried in America.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Fallon</span>. Never fear, Bartley Fallon, but I'll give
you a good burying the day you'll die.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. Maybe it's yourself will be buried in the graveyard
of Cloonmara before me, Mary Fallon, and I myself that
will be dying unbeknownst some night, and no one a-near me.
And the cat itself may be gone straying through the country,
and the mice squealing over the quilt.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Fallon</span>. Leave off talking of dying. It might be
twenty years you'll be living yet.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span> [<i>with a deep sigh</i>]. I'm thinking if I'll be living
at the end of twenty years, it's a very old man I'll be then!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tarpey</span> [<i>turns and sees them</i>]. Good morrow,
Bartley Fallon; good morrow, Mrs. Fallon. Well, Bartley,
you'll find no cause for complaining to-day; they are all saying
it was a good fair.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span> [<i>raising his voice</i>]. It was not a good fair, Mrs.
Tarpey. It was a scattered sort of a fair. If we didn't expect
more, we got less. That's the way with me always; whatever
I have to sell goes down and whatever I have to buy goes up.
If there's ever any misfortune coming to this world, it's on
myself it pitches, like a flock of crows on seed potatoes.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Fallon</span>. Leave off talking of misfortunes, and listen
to Jack Smith that is coming the way, and he singing. [<i>Voice
of</i> <span class="smcap">Jack Smith</span> <i>heard singing:</i>]</p>

<p class="poem20" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em">
I thought, my first love,<br>
<span class="add1em">There'd be but one house between you and me,</span><br>
And I thought I would find<br>
<span class="add1em">Yourself coaxing my child on your knee.</span><br>
Over the tide<br>
<span class="add1em">I would leap with the leap of a swan,</span><br>
Till I came to the side<br>
<span class="add1em">Of the wife of the red-haired man!</span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em;"><span class="min1em">[<span class="smcap">Jack Smith</span> <i>comes in; he is a red-haired man, and is carrying
a hayfork.</i>]</span></p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tarpey</span>. That should be a good song if I had my
hearing.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Fallon</span> [<i>shouting</i>]. It's "The Red-haired Man's
Wife."</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page162" name="page162"></a>(p. 162)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tarpey</span>. I know it well. That's the song that has
a skin on it! [<i>She turns her back to them and goes on arranging
her apples.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Fallon</span>. Where's herself, Jack Smith?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jack Smith</span>. She was delayed with her washing; bleaching
the clothes on the hedge she is, and she daren't leave them, with
all the tinkers that do be passing to the fair. It isn't to the
fair I came myself, but up to the Five Acre Meadow I'm going,
where I have a contract for the hay. We'll get a share of it
into tramps to-day. [<i>He lays down hayfork and lights his
pipe.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. You will not get it into tramps to-day. The rain
will be down on it by evening, and on myself too. It's seldom
I ever started on a journey but the rain would come down on
me before I'd find any place of shelter.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jack Smith</span>. If it didn't itself, Bartley, it is my belief you
would carry a leaky pail on your head in place of a hat, the
way you'd not be without some cause of complaining. [<i>A voice
heard, "Go on, now, go on out o' that. Go on I say."</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jack Smith</span>. Look at that young mare of Pat Ryan's that
is backing into Shaughnessy's bullocks with the dint of the
crowd! Don't be daunted, Pat, I'll give you a hand with her.
[<i>He goes out, leaving his hayfork.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Fallon</span>. It's time for ourselves to be going home. I
have all I bought put in the basket. Look at there, Jack Smith's
hayfork he left after him! He'll be wanting it. [<i>Calls.</i>] Jack
Smith! Jack Smith!&mdash;He's gone through the crowd&mdash;hurry
after him, Bartley, he'll be wanting it.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. I'll do that. This is no safe place to be leaving
it. [<i>He takes up fork awkwardly and upsets the basket.</i>]
Look at that now! If there is any basket in the fair upset, it
must be our own basket! [<i>He goes out to right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Fallon</span>. Get out of that! It is your own fault, it
is. Talk of misfortunes and misfortunes will come. Glory
be! Look at my new egg-cups rolling in every part&mdash;and my
two pound of sugar with the paper broke&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tarpey</span> [<i>turning from stall</i>]. God help us, Mrs.
Fallon, what happened your basket?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Fallon</span>. It's himself that knocked it down, bad manners
to him. [<i>Putting things up.</i>] My grand sugar that's
destroyed, and he'll not drink his tea without it. I had best
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page163" name="page163"></a>(p. 163)</span> go back to the shop for more, much good may it do him!
[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Tim Casey</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Tim Casey</span>. Where is Bartley Fallon, Mrs. Fallon? I
want a word with him before he'll leave the fair. I was
afraid he might have gone home by this, for he's a temperate
man.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Fallon</span>. I wish he did go home! It'd be best for
me if he went home straight from the fair green, or if he
never came with me at all! Where is he, is it? He's gone up
the road [<i>jerks elbow</i>] following Jack Smith with a hayfork.
[<i>She goes out to left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Tim Casey</span>. Following Jack Smith with a hayfork! Did
ever anyone hear the like of that. [<i>Shouts.</i>] Did you hear
that news, Mrs. Tarpey?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tarpey</span>. I heard no news at all.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Tim Casey</span>. Some dispute I suppose it was that rose between
Jack Smith and Bartley Fallon, and it seems Jack made
off, and Bartley is following him with a hayfork!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tarpey</span>. Is he now? Well, that was quick work!
It's not ten minutes since the two of them were here, Bartley
going home and Jack going to the Five Acre Meadow; and I
had my apples to settle up, that Jo Muldoon of the police had
scattered, and when I looked round again Jack Smith was gone,
and Bartley Fallon was gone, and Mrs. Fallon's basket upset,
and all in it strewed upon the ground&mdash;the tea here&mdash;the two
pound of sugar there&mdash;the egg-cups there&mdash;Look, now, what
a great hardship the deafness puts upon me, that I didn't hear
the commincement of the fight! Wait till I tell James Ryan
that I see below; he is a neighbor of Bartley's, it would be a
pity if he wouldn't hear the news! [<i>She goes out. Enter</i>
<span class="smcap">Shawn Early</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Tully</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Tim Casey</span>. Listen, Shawn Early! Listen, Mrs. Tully, to
the news! Jack Smith and Bartley Fallon had a falling out,
and Jack knocked Mrs. Fallon's basket into the road, and
Bartley made an attack on him with a hayfork, and away with
Jack, and Bartley after him. Look at the sugar here yet on
the road!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Shawn Early</span>. Do you tell me so? Well, that's a queer
thing, and Bartley Fallon so quiet a man!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tully</span>. I wouldn't wonder at all. I would never
think well of a man that would have that sort of a moldering
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page164" name="page164"></a>(p. 164)</span> look. It's likely he has overtaken Jack by this. [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">James
Ryan</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Tarpey</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">James Ryan</span>. That is great news Mrs. Tarpey was telling
me! I suppose that's what brought the police and the magistrate
up this way. I was wondering to see them in it a while
ago.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Shawn Early</span>. The police after them? Bartley Fallon
must have injured Jack so. They wouldn't meddle in a fight
that was only for show!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tully</span>. Why wouldn't he injure him? There was
many a man killed with no more of a weapon than a hayfork.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">James Ryan</span>. Wait till I run north as far as Kelly's bar
to spread the news! [<i>He goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Tim Casey</span>. I'll go tell Jack Smith's first cousin that is
standing there south of the church after selling his lambs.
[<i>Goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tully</span>. I'll go telling a few of the neighbors I see
beyond to the west. [<i>Goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Shawn Early</span>. I'll give word of it beyond at the east of
the green. [<i>Is going out when</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Tarpey</span> <i>seizes hold of
him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tarpey</span>. Stop a minute, Shawn Early, and tell me
did you see red Jack Smith's wife, Kitty Keary, in any place?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Shawn Early</span>. I did. At her own house she was, drying
clothes on the hedge as I passed.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tarpey</span>. What did you say she was doing?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Shawn Early</span> [<i>breaking away.</i>] Laying out a sheet on
the hedge. [<i>He goes.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tarpey</span>. Laying out a sheet for the dead! The Lord
have mercy on us! Jack Smith dead, and his wife laying out
a sheet for his burying! [<i>Calls out.</i>] Why didn't you tell me
that before, Shawn Early? Isn't the deafness the great hardship?
Half the world might be dead without me knowing of
it or getting word of it at all! [<i>She sits down and rocks herself.</i>]
Oh, my poor Jack Smith! To be going to his work so
nice and so hearty, and to be left stretched on the ground in
the full light of the day! [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Tim Casey</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Tim Casey</span>. What is it, Mrs. Tarpey? What happened
since?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tarpey</span>. Oh, my poor Jack Smith!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Tim Casey</span>. Did Bartley overtake him?</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page165" name="page165"></a>(p. 165)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tarpey</span>. Oh, the poor man!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Tim Casey</span>. Is it killed he is?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tarpey</span>. Stretched in the Five Acre Meadow!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Tim Casey</span>. The Lord have mercy on us! Is that a
fact?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tarpey</span>. Without the rites of the Church or a
ha'porth!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Tim Casey</span>. Who was telling you?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tarpey</span>. And the wife laying out a sheet for his
corpse. [<i>Sits up and wipes her eyes.</i>] I suppose they'll wake
him the same as another? [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Tully</span>, <span class="smcap">Shawn
Early</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">James Ryan</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tully</span>. There is great talk about this work in every
quarter of the fair.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tarpey</span>. Ochone! cold and dead. And myself maybe
the last he was speaking to!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">James Ryan</span>. The Lord save us! Is it dead he is?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Tim Casey</span>. Dead surely, and the wife getting provision
for the wake.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Shawn Early</span>. Well, now, hadn't Bartley Fallon great
venom in him?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tully</span>. You may be sure he had some cause. Why
would he have made an end of him if he had not? [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Tarpey</span>, <i>raising her voice.</i>] What was it rose the dispute at
all, Mrs. Tarpey?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tarpey</span>. Not a one of me knows. The last I saw
of them, Jack Smith was standing there, and Bartley Fallon
was standing there, quiet and easy, and he listening to "The
Red-haired Man's Wife."</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tully</span>. Do you hear that, Tim Casey? Do you hear
that, Shawn Early and James Ryan? Bartley Fallon was here
this morning listening to red Jack Smith's wife, Kitty Keary
that was! Listening to her and whispering with her! It was
she started the fight so!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Shawn Early</span>. She must have followed him from her own
house. It is likely some person roused him.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Tim Casey</span>. I never knew, before, Bartley Fallon was great
with Jack Smith's wife.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tully</span>. How would you know it? Sure it's not in
the streets they would be calling it. If Mrs. Fallon didn't
know of it, and if I that have the next house to them didn't
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page166" name="page166"></a>(p. 166)</span> know of it, and if Jack Smith himself didn't know of it, it is
not likely you would know of it, Tim Casey.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Shawn Early</span>. Let Bartley Fallon take charge of her from
this out so, and let him provide for her. It is little pity she
will get from any person in this parish.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Tim Casey</span>. How can he take charge of her? Sure he has
a wife of his own. Sure you don't think he'd turn souper and
marry her in a Protestant church?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">James Ryan</span>. It would be easy for him to marry her if he
brought her to America.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Shawn Early</span>. With or without Kitty Keary, believe me
it is for America he's making at this minute. I saw the new
magistrate and Jo Muldoon of the police going into the post-office
as I came up&mdash;there was hurry on them&mdash;you may be
sure it was to telegraph they went, the way he'll be stopped in
the docks at Queenstown!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tully</span>. It's likely Kitty Keary is gone with him, and
not minding a sheet or a wake at all. The poor man, to be
deserted by his own wife, and the breath hardly gone out yet
from his body that is lying bloody in the field! [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Fallon</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Fallon</span>. What is it the whole of the town is talking
about? And what is it you yourselves are talking about?
Is it about my man Bartley Fallon you are talking? Is it
lies about him you are telling, saying that he went killing Jack
Smith? My grief that ever he came into this place at all!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">James Ryan</span>. Be easy now, Mrs. Fallon. Sure there is no
one at all in the whole fair but is sorry for you!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Fallon</span>. Sorry for me, is it? Why would anyone be
sorry for me? Let you be sorry for yourselves, and that there
may be shame on you forever and at the day of judgment, for
the words you are saying and the lies you are telling to take
away the character of my poor man, and to take the good name
off of him, and to drive him to destruction! That is what
you are doing!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Shawn Early</span>. Take comfort now, Mrs. Fallon. The
police are not so smart as they think. Sure he might give them
the slip yet, the same as Lynchehaun.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tully</span>. If they do get him, and if they do put a rope
around his neck, there is no one can say he does not deserve it!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Fallon</span>. Is that what you are saying, Bridget Tully,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page167" name="page167"></a>(p. 167)</span> and is that what you think? I tell you it's too much talk you
have, making yourself out to be such a great one, and to be
running down every respectable person! A rope, is it? It isn't
much of a rope was needed to tie up your own furniture the
day you came into Martin Tully's house, and you never bringing
as much as a blanket, or a penny, or a suit of clothes with
you and I myself bringing seventy pounds and two feather
beds. And now you are stiffer than a woman would have a
hundred pounds! It is too much talk the whole of you have.
A rope is it? I tell you the whole of this town is full of liars
and schemers that would hang you up for half a glass of
whisky. [<i>Turning to go.</i>] People they are you wouldn't believe
as much as daylight from without you'd get up to have a
look at it yourself. Killing Jack Smith indeed! Where are
you at all, Bartley, till I bring you out of this? My nice quiet
little man! My decent comrade! He that is as kind and as
harmless as an innocent beast of the field! He'll be doing no
harm at all if he'll shed the blood of some of you after this
day's work! That much would be no harm at all. [<i>Calls
out.</i>] Bartley! Bartley Fallon! Where are you? [<i>Going
out.</i>] Did anyone see Bartley Fallon? [<i>All turn to look after
her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">James Ryan</span>. It is hard for her to believe any such a thing,
God help her! [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Bartley Fallon</span> <i>from right, carrying
hayfork.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. It is what I often said to myself, if there is ever
any misfortune coming to this world it is on myself it is sure to
come! [<i>All turn round and face him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. To be going about with this fork and to find no
one to take it, and no place to leave it down, and I wanting
to be gone out of this&mdash;Is that you, Shawn Early? [<i>Holds
out fork.</i>] It's well I met you. You have no call to be leaving
the fair for a while the way I have, and how can I go till
I'm rid of this fork? Will you take it and keep it until such
time as Jack Smith&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Shawn Early</span> [<i>backing</i>]. I will not take it, Bartley Fallon,
I'm very thankful to you!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span> [<i>turning to apple stall</i>]. Look at it now, Mrs.
Tarpey, it was here I got it; let me thrust it in under the stall.
It will lie there safe enough, and no one will take notice of it
until such time as Jack Smith&mdash;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page168" name="page168"></a>(p. 168)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tarpey</span>. Take your fork out of that! Is it to put
trouble on me and to destroy me you want? putting it there
for the police to be rooting it out maybe. [<i>Thrusts him
back.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. That is a very unneighborly thing for you to do,
Mrs. Tarpey. Hadn't I enough care on me with that fork before
this, running up and down with it like the swinging of a
clock, and afeard to lay it down in any place! I wish I never
touched it or meddled with it at all!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">James Ryan</span>. It is a pity, indeed, you ever did.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. Will you yourself take it, James Ryan? You
were always a neighborly man.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">James Ryan</span> [<i>backing</i>]. There is many a thing I would do
for you, Bartley Fallon, but I won't do that!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Shawn Early</span>. I tell you there is no man will give you
any help or any encouragement for this day's work. If it was
something agrarian now&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. If no one at all will take it, maybe it's best to
give it up to the police.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Tim Casey</span>. There'd be a welcome for it with them surely!
[<i>Laughter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tully</span>. And it is to the police Kitty Keary herself
will be brought.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tarpey</span> [<i>rocking to and fro</i>]. I wonder now who
will take the expense of the wake for poor Jack Smith?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. The wake for Jack Smith!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Tim Casey</span>. Why wouldn't he get a wake as well as
another? Would you begrudge him that much?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. Red Jack Smith dead! Who was telling you?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Shawn Early</span>. The whole town knows of it by this.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. Do they say what way did he die?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">James Ryan</span>. You don't know that yourself, I suppose,
Bartley Fallon? You don't know he was followed and that
he was laid dead with the stab of a hayfork?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. The stab of a hayfork!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Shawn Early</span>. You don't know, I suppose, that the body
was found in the Five Acre Meadow?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. The Five Acre Meadow!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Tim Casey</span>. It is likely you don't know that the police
are after the man that did it?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. The man that did it!</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page169" name="page169"></a>(p. 169)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tully</span>. You don't know, maybe, that he was made
away with for the sake of Kitty Keary, his wife?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. Kitty Keary, his wife! [<i>Sits down bewildered.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tully</span>. And what have you to say now, Bartley
Fallon?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span> [<i>crossing himself</i>]. I to bring that fork here, and
to find that news before me! It is much if I can ever stir from
this place at all, or reach as far as the road!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Tim Casey</span>. Look, boys, at the new magistrate, and
Jo Muldoon along with him! It's best for us to quit
this.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Shawn Early</span>. That is so. It is best not to be mixed in
this business at all.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">James Ryan</span>. Bad as he is, I wouldn't like to be an informer
against any man. [<i>All hurry away except</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Tarpey</span>, <i>who remains behind her stall. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Magistrate</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Policeman</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. I knew the district was in a bad state, but I
did not expect to be confronted with a murder at the first fair
I came to.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Policeman</span>. I am sure you did not, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. It was well I had not gone home. I caught
a few words here and there that roused my suspicions.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Policeman</span>. So they would, too.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. You heard the same story from everyone you
asked?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Policeman</span>. The same story&mdash;or if it was not altogether
the same, anyway it was no less than the first story.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. What is that man doing? He is sitting alone
with a hayfork. He has a guilty look. The murder was done
with a hayfork!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Policeman</span> [<i>in a whisper</i>]. That's the very man they say
did the act; Bartley Fallon himself!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. He must have found escape difficult&mdash;he is
trying to brazen it out. A convict in the Andaman Islands
tried the same game, but he could not escape my system! Stand
aside&mdash;Don't go far&mdash;have the handcuffs ready. [<i>He walks
up to</i> <span class="smcap">Bartley</span>, <i>folds his arms, and stands before him.</i>] Here,
my man, do you know anything of John Smith?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. Of John Smith! Who is he, now?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Policeman</span>. Jack Smith, sir&mdash;Red Jack Smith!</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page170" name="page170"></a>(p. 170)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span> [<i>coming a step nearer and tapping him on the
shoulder</i>]. Where is Jack Smith?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span> [<i>with a deep sigh, and shaking his head slowly</i>].
Where is he, indeed?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. What have you to tell?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. It is where he was this morning, standing in this
spot, singing his share of songs&mdash;no, but lighting his pipe&mdash;scraping
a match on the sole of his shoe&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. I ask you, for the third time, where is he?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. I wouldn't like to say that. It is a great mystery,
and it is hard to say of any man, did he earn hatred
or love.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. Tell me all you know.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. All that I know&mdash;Well, there are the three
estates; there is Limbo, and there is Purgatory, and there is&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. Nonsense! This is trifling! Get to the
point.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. Maybe you don't hold with the clergy so? That
is the teaching of the clergy. Maybe you hold with the old
people. It is what they do be saying, that the shadow goes
wandering, and the soul is tired, and the body is taking a rest&mdash;The
shadow! [<i>Starts up.</i>] I was nearly sure I saw Jack
Smith not ten minutes ago at the corner of the forge, and I
lost him again&mdash;Was it his ghost I saw, do you think?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span> [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Policeman</span>]. Conscience-struck! He will
confess all now!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. His ghost to come before me! It is likely it was
on account of the fork! I to have it and he to have no way
to defend himself the time he met with his death!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span> [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Policeman</span>]. I must note down his words.
[<i>Takes out notebook.</i>] [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Bartley</span>.] I warn you that
your words are being noted.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. If I had ha' run faster in the beginning, this
terror would not be on me at the latter end! Maybe he will
cast it up against me at the day of judgment&mdash;I wouldn't
wonder at all at that.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span> [<i>writing</i>]. At the day of judgment&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. It was soon for his ghost to appear to me&mdash;is it
coming after me always by day it will be, and stripping the
clothes off in the night time?&mdash;I wouldn't wonder at all at
that, being as I am an unfortunate man!</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page171" name="page171"></a>(p. 171)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span> [<i>sternly</i>]. Tell me this truly. What was the
motive of this crime?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. The motive, is it?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. Yes; the motive; the cause.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. I'd sooner not say that.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. You had better tell me truly. Was it money?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. Not at all! What did poor Jack Smith ever
have in his pockets unless it might be his hands that would be
in them?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. Any dispute about land?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span> [<i>indignantly</i>]. Not at all! He never was a
grabber or grabbed from anyone!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. You will find it better for you if you tell
me at once.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. I tell you I wouldn't for the whole world wish
to say what it was&mdash;it is a thing I would not like to be talking
about.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. There is no use in hiding it. It will be discovered
in the end.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. Well, I suppose it will, seeing that mostly everybody
knows it before. Whisper here now. I will tell no lie;
where would be the use? [<i>Puts his hand to his mouth, and</i>
<span class="smcap">Magistrate</span> <i>stoops.</i>] Don't be putting the blame on the
parish, for such a thing was never done in the parish before&mdash;it
was done for the sake of Kitty Keary, Jack Smith's
wife.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span> [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Policeman</span>]. Put on the handcuffs. We
have been saved some trouble. I knew he would confess if
taken in the right way. [<span class="smcap">Policeman</span> <i>puts on handcuffs.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. Handcuffs now! Glory be! I always said, if
there was ever any misfortune coming to this place it was on
myself it would fall. I to be in handcuffs! There's no wonder
at all in that. [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Fallon</span>, <i>followed by the rest.
She is looking back at them as she speaks.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Fallon</span>. Telling lies the whole of the people of this
town are; telling lies, telling lies as fast as a dog will trot!
Speaking against my poor respectable man! Saying he made
an end of Jack Smith! My decent comrade! There is no
better man and no kinder man in the whole of the five parishes!
It's little annoyance he ever gave to anyone! [<i>Turns and sees
him.</i>] What in the earthly world do I see before me? Bartley
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page172" name="page172"></a>(p. 172)</span> Fallon in charge of the police! Handcuffs on him! Oh, Bartley,
what did you do at all at all?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. Oh, Mary, there has a great misfortune come
upon me! It is what I always said, that if there is ever any
misfortune&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Fallon</span>. What did he do at all, or is it bewitched
I am?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. This man has been arrested on a charge of
murder.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Fallon</span>. Whose charge is that? Don't believe
them! They are all liars in this place! Give me back my
man!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. It is natural you should take his part, but
you have no cause of complaint against your neighbors. He has
been arrested for the murder of John Smith, on his own confession.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Fallon</span>. The saints of heaven protect us! And what
did he want killing Jack Smith?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Magistrate</span>. It is best you should know all. He did it on
account of a love affair with the murdered man's wife.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Fallon</span> [<i>sitting down</i>]. With Jack Smith's wife!
With Kitty Keary!&mdash;Ochone, the traitor!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Crowd</span>. A great shame, indeed. He is a traitor,
indeed.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Tully</span>. To America he was bringing her, Mrs.
Fallon.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. What are you saying, Mary? I tell you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Fallon</span>. Don't say a word! I won't listen to any
word you'll say! [<i>Stops her ears.</i>] Oh, isn't he the treacherous
villain? Ohone go deo!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. Be quiet till I speak! Listen to what I say!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Fallon</span>. Sitting beside me on the ass car coming to
the town, so quiet and so respectable, and treachery like that
in his heart!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. Is it your wits you have lost or is it I myself that
have lost my wits?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Fallon</span>. And it's hard I earned you, slaving, slaving&mdash;and
you grumbling, and sighing, and coughing, and discontented,
and the priest wore out anointing you, with all the
times you threatened to die!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. Let you be quiet till I tell you!</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page173" name="page173"></a>(p. 173)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Fallon</span>. You to bring such a disgrace into the parish.
A thing that was never heard of before!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. Will you shut your mouth and hear me speaking?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Fallon</span>. And if it was for any sort of a fine handsome
woman, but for a little fistful of a woman like Kitty
Keary, that's not four feet high hardly, and not three teeth in
her head unless she got new ones! May God reward you,
Bartley Fallon, for the black treachery in your heart and the
wickedness in your mind, and the red blood of poor Jack
Smith that is wet upon your hand! [<i>Voice of</i> <span class="smcap">Jack Smith</span>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jack Smith</span>. It is what I think, the wits are gone astray
on the whole of you. What would my wife want bringing
Bartley Fallon to America?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Mrs. Fallon</span>. To leave yourself, and to get quit of you she
wants, Jack Smith, and to bring him away from myself. That's
what the two of them had settled together.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Jack Smith</span>. I'll break the head of any man that says that!

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page176" name="page176"></a>(p. 176)</span> AUTHOR'S NOTE</h2>

<p>The idea of this play first came to me as a tragedy. I kept seeing as
in a picture people sitting by the roadside, and a girl passing to the
market, gay and fearless. And then I saw her passing by the same
place at evening, her head hanging, the heads of others turned from
her, because of some sudden story that had risen out of a chance word,
and had snatched away her good name.</p>

<p>But comedy and not tragedy was wanted at our theatre to put beside
the high poetic work, <i>The King's Threshold</i>, <i>The Shadowy Waters</i>,
<i>On Baile's Strand</i>, <i>The Well of the Saints</i>; and I let laughter have
its way with the little play. I was delayed in beginning it for a
while, because I could only think of Bartley Fallon as dull-witted or
silly or ignorant, and the handcuffs seemed too harsh a punishment.
But one day by the seat at Duras a melancholy man who was telling
me of the crosses he had gone through at home said&mdash;"But I'm thinking
if I went to America, it's long ago to-day I'd be dead. And it's a
great expense for a poor man to be buried in America." Bartley was
born at that moment, and, far from harshness, I felt I was providing
him with a happy old age in giving him the lasting glory of that great
and crowning day of misfortune.</p>

<p>It has been acted very often by other companies as well as our own,
and the Boers have done me the honor of translating and pirating it.</p>

<span class="smaller">By<br>
JEANNETTE MARKS</span></h1>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page179" name="page179"></a>(p. 179)</span> Jeannette Marks, playwright, poet, essayist, and writer of
short stories, was born in 1875 at Chattanooga, Tennessee. She
grew up in Philadelphia, however, where her father was a
member of the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania. Her
education in this country was supplemented by a sojourn at a
school in Dresden. She took her first degree at Wellesley College
in 1900, and her master's degree there in 1903. Her
graduate studies were pursued at the Bodleian Library and at
the British Museum. Since 1901 she has taught English literature
at Mount Holyoke.</p>

<p>The play here reprinted, <i>Welsh Honeymoon</i>, was one of the
two&mdash;the other was her <i>The Merry, Merry Cuckoo</i>&mdash;that won
the Welsh National Theatre First Prize for the best Welsh
plays in November, 1911, the year after Josephine Preston
Peabody had carried off the palm at Stratford-on-Avon.</p>

<p>She writes in her preface to <i>Three Welsh Plays</i>, the collection
from which <i>Welsh Honeymoon</i> is drawn:</p>

<p>"'Poetry' and 'song' are words which convey, better than
any other two words could, the priceless gifts of the Welsh
people to the world. With their love for music, for beauty,
for the significance of their land and its folklore, their inherent
romance in the difficult art of living, they have transformed
ugliness into beauty, turned loneliness into speech, and ever
recalled life to its only permanent possessions in wonder and
romance.</p>

<p>"Curiously enough, the Welsh, rich in poetry and music,
have been almost altogether devoid of plays. But no one who
has read those first Welsh tales in the 'Mabinogion' (c. 1260)
could for an instant think the Cymru devoid of the dramatic
instinct. The Welsh way of interpreting experience is essentially
dramatic. <i>The Dream of Maxen Wledig</i>, <i>The Dream
of Rhonabwy</i>, both from the 'Mabinogion,' are sharply dramatic,
although then and later Welsh literature remained practically
devoid of the play form. Experience dramatized is, too,
that Pilgrim's Progress of Gwalia: 'Y Bardd Cwsg' (1703).</p>

<p>"Every gift of the Welsh would seem to promise the realization
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page180" name="page180"></a>(p. 180)</span> some day of a great national drama, for they have not only
the gift of poetry and the power to seize the symbol&mdash;short cut
through experience&mdash;which can, even as the crutch of Ibsen's
Little Eyolf, lift a play into greatness; they have, also, natures
profoundly emotional and yet intellectually critical. They are,
humanly speaking, perfect tools for the achievement of great
drama. But it is a drab journey from those 'Mabinogion'
days of wonder, coarse and crude as they were in many ways,
yet intensely vital, through the 'Bardd Cwsg' to Twm o'r
Nant (1739-1810) the so-called 'Welsh Shakespeare,' whose
Interludes might, with sufficient worrying, afford delectation
to the rock-ribbed Puritanism which has stood, as much as any
other oppression, in the way of Gwalia's full development of
her genius for beauty.</p>

<p>"It was, then, a significant moment when 'The Welsh National
Theatre' came into existence with so powerful a patron
as Lord Howard de Walden, lessee of the Haymarket, and
Owen Rhoscomyl (Captain Owen Vaughan) and other gifted
Welsh literati for its sponsors. And it did not seem an insignificant
moment to one person, the playwright of <i>The Merry
Merry Cuckoo</i> and <i>Welsh Honeymoon</i>, when she learned
through her friendly agent, Curtis Brown of London, that she
had received one of the Welsh National Theatre's first prizes
(1911)."</p>

<p>Jeannette Marks's interest in Wales is the result of a number
of holidays spent in wandering through its highways and
byways. Books of hers like <i>Through Welsh Doorways</i> and
<i>Gallant Little Wales</i> bespeak an affectionate intimacy with
homes and inhabitants. In the last named, especially, the chapters
called "Cambrian Cottages" and "Welsh Wales" contain
material that is highly illuminating in connection with the interpretation
of her plays. Edward Knobloch, the playwright, is
said to have pointed out to the author the dramatic situations
inherent in her short stories and sketches, a suggestion which
bore fruit in <i>Three Welsh Plays</i>.</p>

<p>The first performance of <i>Welsh Honeymoon</i> was given by
the American Drama Society in Boston in February, 1916. It
has also been produced by the Boston Women's City Club, the
Vagabond Players in Baltimore, the Hull House Players in
Chicago, and the Prince Street Players in Rochester.</p>

<p><i>PLACE.</i>&mdash;<i>Beddgelert, a little village in North Wales.</i></p>

<p class="opening"><span class="min10pc"><i>A Welsh kitchen. At back, in center, a deep ingle, with two
hobs and fire bars fixed between, on either side settles. On
the left-hand side near the fire a church; on the right, in
a pile, some peat ready for use. Above the fireplace is a
mantel on which are set some brass candlesticks, a deep
copper cheese bowl, and two pewter plates. Near the left
settle is a three-legged table set with teapot, cups and
saucers for two, a plate of bread and butter, a plate of
jam, and a creamer. At the right and to the right of the
door, is a tall, highly polished, oaken grandfather's clock,
with a shining brass face; to the left of the door is a
tridarn. The tridarn dresser is lined with bright blue
paper and filled with luster china. The floor is of beaten
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page182" name="page182"></a>(p. 182)</span> clay, whitewashed around the edges; from the rafters of
the peaked ceiling hang flitches of bacon, hams, and bunches
of onions and herbs. On the hearth is a copper kettle
singing gaily; and on either side of the fireplace are
latticed windows opening into the kitchen. Through the
door to the right, when open, may be seen the flagstones
and cottages of a Welsh village street; through latticed
windows the twinkling of many village lights.</i></span></p>

<p class="opening"><span class="min10pc"><i>It is about half after eleven on Allhallows' Eve in the
village of Beddgelert.</i></span></p>

the fire is burning brightly, and two candles are lighted on
the mantelpiece.</i> <span class="smcap">Vavasour Jones</span>, <i>about thirty-five years
old, dressed in a striped vest, a short, heavy blue coat, cut
away in front, and with swallowtails behind, and trimmed
with brass buttons, and somewhat tight trousers down to
his boot tops, is standing by the open door at the right,
looking out anxiously on to the glittering, rain-wet flagstone
street and calling after someone.</i></span></p>

throws his weight against the door. Calling and holding hard

'Tis the night when Catherine must go.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Eilir Morris</span>. When Aunt Kats must go! What do you
mean?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Vavasour</span>. She'll be dead to-night at twelve.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Eilir Morris</span> [<i>bewildered</i>]. Dead at twelve? But she's at
Pally Hughes's. Does she know it?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Vavasour</span>. No, but I do, an' to think I've been unkind to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page185" name="page185"></a>(p. 185)</span> her! I've tried this year to make up for it, but 'tis no use, lad;
one year'll never make up for ten of harsh words, whatever.
Ow! [<i>Groaning,</i> <span class="smcap">Vavasour</span> <i>collapses on to the settle
and rocks to and fro, moaning aloud.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Eilir Morris</span> [<i>mystified</i>]. Well, ye've not been good to
her, Uncle, that's certain; but ye've been different the past
year.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Vavasour</span> [<i>sobbing</i>]. Aye, but a year'll not do any good,
an' she'll be dyin' at twelve to-night. Ow! I've turned to the
scriptures to see what it says about a man an' his wife, but
it'll no do, no do, no do!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Eilir Morris</span>. Have ye been drinkin', Uncle?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Vavasour</span> [<i>hotly</i>]. Drinkin'!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Eilir Morris</span>. Well, indeed, no harm, but, Uncle, I cannot
understand why Aunt Kats's goin' an' where.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Vavasour</span> [<i>rising suddenly from the settle and seizing</i> <span class="smcap">Eilir</span>
<i>by the coat lapel</i>]. She's goin' to leave me, lad; 'tis Allhallows'
Eve whatever! An' she'll be dyin' at twelve. Aye, a year ago
things were so bad between us, on Allhallows' Eve I went down
to the church porch shortly before midnight to see whether the
spirit of your Aunt Kats would be called an'&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Eilir Morris</span>. Uncle, 'twas fair killin' her!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Vavasour</span>. I wanted to see whether she would live the
twelve months out. An' as I was leanin' against the church
wall, hopin', aye, lad, prayin' to see her spirit there, an' know
she'd die, I saw somethin' comin' 'round the corner with white
over its head.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Eilir Morris</span> [<i>wailing</i>]. Ow&mdash;w!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Vavasour</span>. It drew nearer an' nearer, an' when it came in
full view of the church porch, it paused, it whirled around like
that, an' sped away with the shroud flappin' about its feet, an'
the rain beatin' down on its white hood.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Eilir Morris</span> [<i>wailing again</i>]. Ow&mdash;w!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Vavasour</span>. But there was time to see that it was the
spirit of Catherine, an' I was glad because my wicked prayer
had been answered, an' because with Catherine dyin' the next
Allhallows', we'd have to live together only the year out.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Eilir Morris</span> [<i>raising his hand</i>]. Hush, what's that?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Vavasour</span>. 'Tis voices whatever. [<i>Both listen,</i> <span class="smcap">Eilir</span> <i>goes

have to live together, an', considerin' as 'twas the last year,
I might just as well try to be decent an' kind. An' when I
reached home, Catherine was up waitin' for me an' spoke so
pleasantly, an' we sat down an' had a long talk&mdash;just like the
days when we were courtin'.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Vavasour</span> [<i>puzzled</i>]. Nay, how could she know. But she
seems queer,&mdash;as if she felt the evil comin'. Well, indeed, each
day was sweeter than the one before, an' we were man an' wife

callin'; aye, goin' there, hopin' ye'd see her spirit, an' countin'
on her death!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Eilir Morris</span> [<i>mournfully</i>]. Aye, Uncle, 'tis bad, an' I've
no word to say to ye for comfort. I recollect well the story
Granny used to tell about Christmas Pryce; 'twas somethin' the

Geffery, his friend, an' Silvan had just time to dig Geffery's

it. Can you no comfort me?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Catherine</span> [<i>starting for the bowl again but turning on

JOHN MILLINGTON SYNGE</span></h1>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page195" name="page195"></a>(p. 195)</span> "He was of a dark type of Irishman, though not black-haired.
Something in his air gave one the fancy that his face
was dark from gravity. Gravity filled the face and haunted
it, as though the man behind were forever listening to life's
case before passing judgment.... When someone spoke to
him he answered with grave Irish courtesy. When the talk
became general he was silent.... His manner was that of
a man too much interested in the life about him to wish to be
more than a spectator. His interest was in life, not in ideas."
In these words, John Masefield gives his first impressions of
John Millington Synge, whom he met at a friend's house, in
London, in January, 1903.</p>

<p>Synge, born April 16, 1871, at Newton Little, near Dublin,
and dying in Dublin, March 24, 1909, belongs to that group
of "inheritors of unfulfilled renown" who died before the
prime of life was reached. He left six plays, notable the
<i>Riders to the Sea</i> and <i>Deirdre of the Sorrows</i>, that are among
the greatest in our language. He was delicate from the beginning,
and after some education in private schools in Dublin
and Bray, left school when about fourteen and studied with a
tutor. In 1892 he took his B.A. degree from Trinity College,
Dublin, whose rolls contain a number of names famous in English
literature. While at college, he studied music at the Royal
Irish Academy of Music, where he won a scholarship. His first
impulse was to make music his career, and he spent portions
of the next four years in Germany, France, and Italy studying
music and traveling. In May, 1898, he first went to the Aran
Islands, later to be the scene of <i>Riders to the Sea</i>. Thereafter
in Paris in 1899 he met Yeats, who advised him to go
back to the Aran Islands to renew his contact with the simple
folk there. For the next three years he divided his time between
Paris and Ireland. It was in 1904 that his play, <i>Riders to the
Sea</i>,<a id="footnotetag42" name="footnotetag42"></a><a href="#footnote42" title="Go to footnote 42"><span class="smaller">[42]</span></a> was first produced. He was at Dublin that same year
for the opening of the Abbey Theatre, of which he was one of
the advisers. Whenever the Irish Players visited England, he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page196" name="page196"></a>(p. 196)</span> traveled with them. In 1909 came the operation that ended
his life.</p>

<p>Synge's book, <i>The Aran Islands</i>, which is a record of his
various visits to these three islands lying about thirty miles off
the coast of County Galway, is full of material that throws
light on the setting and characterization of <i>Riders to the Sea</i>.
The central incident in this play was suggested to Synge while
he was sojourning on Inishmaan, the middle island of the Aran
group, by a tale that he heard of a man whose body had been
washed up on a distant coast, and who had been identified as
belonging to the Islands, because of his characteristic garments.
When on Inishmaan, Synge himself lived in just such a cottage
as that which is the background for the tragedy of Maurya's
sons. He wrote of this cottage, "The kitchen itself, where I
will spend most of my time, is full of beauty and distinction.
The red dresses of the women who cluster round the fire on
their stools give a glow of almost Eastern richness, and the
walls have been toned by the surf-smoke to a soft brown that
blends with the gray earth-color of the floor. Many sorts of
fishing-tackle, and the nets and oilskins of the men, are hung up
on the walls or among the open rafters." And the following
passage from his <i>Aran Islands</i> is an eloquent description of the
atmosphere there: "A week of smoking fog has passed over and
given me a strange sense of exile and desolation. I walk round
the island nearly every day, yet I can see nothing anywhere
but a mass of wet rock, a strip of surf, and then a tumult of
waves.</p>

<p>"The slaty limestone has grown black with the water that
is dripping on it, and wherever I turn there is the same gray
obsession twining and wreathing itself among the narrow fields,
and the same wail from the wind that shrieks and whistles in
the loose rubble of the walls."</p>

<p>Mr. Masefield, in his recollections of Synge, reports also the
following conversation between himself and the Irish playwright:
Synge saying, "They [the islanders] asked me to fiddle
to them so that they might dance," and Mr. Masefield asking,
"Do you play, then?" and Synge answering, "I fiddle a little.
I try to learn something different for them every time. The
last time I learned to do conjuring tricks. They'd get tired of
me if I didn't bring something new. I'm thinking of learning
the penny whistle before I go again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page197" name="page197"></a>(p. 197)</span> A later visitor<a id="footnotetag43" name="footnotetag43"></a><a href="#footnote43" title="Go to footnote 43"><span class="smaller">[43]</span></a> to the Aran Islands, Miss B. N. Hedderman,
a district nurse, gives further evidences of the simplicity of
those people from whom the characters of <i>Riders to the Sea</i>
were drawn. She tells of a man who owned a house with two
comfortable rooms in it, one of which he leveled ruthlessly
because he had dreamed that it hindered the passage of the
"good people." The illustrations in her little book showing
cottage interiors and peasant costumes will be found useful by
groups who are planning to produce <i>Riders to the Sea</i>. But
the best guide to the costumes and social life of the West of
Ireland is J. B. Yeats.<a id="footnotetag44" name="footnotetag44"></a><a href="#footnote44" title="Go to footnote 44"><span class="smaller">[44]</span></a></p>

<p>The <i>Drama Calendar</i> of December 13, 1920, offers the following
suggestion for a musical setting for the play: "The
attention of Little Theatre directors is called to a musical prelude
to Synge's <i>Riders to the Sea</i>, arranged by Henry F.
Gilbert from the Symphonic Prologue, which was played at the
Worcester Musical Festival this fall. This original arrangement
of the material is intended to build the mood which the
play sustains, and is simply orchestrated for seven instruments.
Every Little Theatre should be able to gather such an orchestra.
Here is an opportunity to give continuity to a program of one-acts;
music answers a question which is one of the hardest the
director has to solve: how a mood which is to be created and
sustained in the brief space of twenty minutes shall not be too
fleeting."</p>

<p class="opening"><span class="min10pc"><i>Cottage kitchen, with nets, oil-skins, spinning wheel, some new
boards standing by the wall, etc.</i> <span class="smcap">Cathleen</span>, <i>a girl of
about twenty, finishes kneading cake, and puts it down in
the pot-oven by the fire; then wipes her hands, and begins
to spin at the wheel.</i> <span class="smcap">Nora</span>, <i>a young girl, puts her head
in at the door.</i></span></p>

<div class="gettys">
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span> [<i>in a low voice</i>]. Where is she?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span>. She's lying down, God help her, and may be
sleeping, if she's able. [<span class="smcap">Nora</span> <i>comes in softly, and takes a
bundle from under her shawl.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>spinning the wheel rapidly</i>]. What is it you
have?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span>. The young priest is after bringing them. It's a shirt
and a plain stocking were got off a drowned man in Donegal.
[<span class="smcap">Cathleen</span> <i>stops her wheel with a sudden movement, and
leans out to listen.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span>. We're to find out if it's Michael's they are, some
time herself will be down looking by the sea.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page199" name="page199"></a>(p. 199)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span>. How would they be Michael's, Nora? How
would he go the length of that way to the far north?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span>. The young priest says he's known the like of it.
"If it's Michael's they are," says he, "you can tell herself
he's got a clean burial by the grace of God, and if they're not
his, let no one say a word about them, for she'll be getting
her death," says he, "with crying and lamenting." [<i>The door
which</i> <span class="smcap">Nora</span> <i>half closed is blown open by a gust of wind.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>looking out anxiously</i>]. Did you ask him would
he stop Bartley going this day with the horses to the Galway
fair?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span>. "I won't stop him," says he, "but let you not be
afraid. Herself does be saying prayers half through the night,
and the Almighty God won't leave her destitute," says he,
"with no son living."</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span>. Is the sea bad by the white rocks, Nora?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span>. Middling bad, God help us. There's a great roaring
in the west, and it's worse it'll be getting when the tide's
turned to the wind. [<i>She goes over to the table with the
bundle.</i>] Shall I open it now?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span>. Maybe she'd wake up on us, and come in before
we'd done. [<i>Coming to the table.</i>] It's a long time we'll
be, and the two of us crying.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span> [<i>goes to the inner door and listens</i>]. She's moving
about on the bed. She'll be coming in a minute.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span>. Give me the ladder, and I'll put them up in
the turf-loft, the way she won't know of them at all, and
maybe when the tide turns she'll be going down to see would
he be floating from the east. [<i>They put the ladder against the
gable of the chimney;</i> <span class="smcap">Cathleen</span> <i>goes up a few steps and
hides the bundle in the turf-loft.</i> <span class="smcap">Maurya</span> <i>comes from the
inner room.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span> [<i>looking up at</i> <span class="smcap">Cathleen</span> <i>and speaking querulously.</i>]
Isn't it turf enough you have for this day and evening?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span>. There's a cake baking at the fire for a short
space [<i>throwing down the turf</i>] and Bartley will want it when
the tide turns if he goes to Connemara. [<span class="smcap">Nora</span> <i>picks up the
turf and puts it round the pot-oven.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span> [<i>sitting down on a stool at the fire</i>]. He won't
go this day with the wind rising from the south and west. He
won't go this day, for the young priest will stop him surely.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page200" name="page200"></a>(p. 200)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span>. He'll not stop him, mother, and I heard Eamon
Simon and Stephen Pheety and Colum Shawn saying he
would go.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span>. Where is he itself?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span>. He went down to see would there be another boat
sailing in the week, and I'm thinking it won't be long till he's
here now, for the tide's turning at the green head, and the
hooker's tacking from the east.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span>. I hear someone passing the big stones.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span> [<i>looking out</i>]. He's coming now, and he in a hurry.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span> [<i>comes in and looks round the room. Speaking
sadly and quietly</i>]. Where is the bit of new rope, Cathleen,
was bought in Connemara?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>coming down</i>]. Give it to him, Nora; it's on
a nail by the white boards. I hung it up this morning, for
the pig with the black feet was eating it.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span> [<i>giving him a rope</i>]. Is that it, Bartley?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span>. You'd do right to leave that rope, Bartley, hanging
by the boards. [<span class="smcap">Bartley</span> <i>takes the rope.</i>] It will be
wanting in this place, I'm telling you, if Michael is washed up
to-morrow morning, or the next morning, or any morning in
the week, for it's a deep grave we'll make him by the grace
of God.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span> [<i>beginning to work with the rope</i>]. I've no halter
the way I can ride down on the mare, and I must go now
quickly. This is the one boat going for two weeks or beyond
it, and the fair will be a good fair for horses I heard them
saying below.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span>. It's a hard thing they'll be saying below if the
body is washed up and there's no man in it to make the coffin,
and I after giving a big price for the finest white boards you'd
find in Connemara. [<i>She looks round at the boards.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span>. How would it be washed up, and we after looking
each day for nine days, and a strong wind blowing a while
back from the west and south?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span>. If it wasn't found itself, that wind is raising the
sea, and there was a star up against the moon, and it rising in
the night. If it was a hundred horses, or a thousand horses
you had itself, what is the price of a thousand horses against
a son where there is one son only?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span> [<i>working at the halter, to</i> <span class="smcap">Cathleen</span>]. Let you
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page201" name="page201"></a>(p. 201)</span> go down each day, and see the sheep aren't jumping in on the
rye, and if the jobber comes you can sell the pig with the black
feet if there is a good price going.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span>. How would the like of her get a good price for
a pig?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span> [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Cathleen</span>]. If the west wind holds with the
last bit of the moon let you and Nora get up weed enough for
another cock for the kelp. It's hard set we'll be from this day
with no one in it but one man to work.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span>. It's hard set we'll be surely the day you're
drownd'd with the rest. What way will I live and the girls
with me, and I an old woman looking for the grave? [<span class="smcap">Bartley</span>
<i>lays down the halter, takes off his old coat, and puts on a
newer one of the same flannel.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span> [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Nora</span>]. Is she coming to the pier?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span> [<i>looking out</i>]. She's passing the green head and letting
fall her sails.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span> [<i>getting his purse and tobacco</i>]. I'll have half an
hour to go down, and you'll see me coming again in two days,
or in three days, or maybe in four days if the wind is bad.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span> [<i>turning round to the fire, and putting her shawl
over her head</i>]. Isn't it a hard and cruel man won't hear a
word from an old woman, and she holding him from the sea?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span>. It's the life of a young man to be going on the
sea, and who would listen to an old woman with one thing
and she saying it over?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bartley</span> [<i>taking the halter</i>]. I must go now quickly. I'll
ride down on the red mare, and the gray pony'll run behind
me.... The blessing of God on you. [<i>He goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span> [<i>crying out as he is in the door</i>]. He's gone now,
God spare us, and we'll not see him again. He's gone now,
and when the black night is falling I'll have no son left me
in the world.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span>. Why wouldn't you give him your blessing and
he looking round in the door? Isn't it sorrow enough is on
everyone in this house without your sending him out with
an unlucky word behind him, and a hard word in his ear?
[<span class="smcap">Maurya</span> <i>takes up the tongs and begins raking the fire aimlessly
without looking round.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span> [<i>turning towards her</i>]. You're taking away the turf
from the cake.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page202" name="page202"></a>(p. 202)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>crying out</i>]. The Son of God forgive us, Nora,
we're after forgetting his bit of bread. [<i>She comes over to
the fire.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span>. And it's destroyed he'll be going till dark night,
and he after eating nothing since the sun went up.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>turning the cake out of the oven</i>]. It's destroyed
he'll be, surely. There's no sense left on any person in a house
where an old woman will be talking forever. [<span class="smcap">Maurya</span> <i>sways
herself on her stool.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>cutting off some of the bread and rolling it in
a cloth; to</i> <span class="smcap">Maurya</span>]. Let you go down now to the spring
well and give him this and he passing. You'll see him then
and the dark word will be broken, and you can say "God
speed you," the way he'll be easy in his mind.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span> [<i>taking the bread</i>]. Will I be in it as soon as
himself?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span>. If you go now quickly.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span> [<i>standing up unsteadily</i>]. It's hard set I am to
walk.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>looking at her anxiously</i>]. Give her the stick,
Nora, or maybe she'll slip on the big stones.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span>. What stick?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span>. The stick Michael brought from Connemara.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span> [<i>taking a stick</i> <span class="smcap">Nora</span> <i>gives her</i>]. In the big
world the old people do be leaving things after them for their
sons and children, but in this place it is the young men do be
leaving things behind for them that do be old. [<i>She goes out
slowly.</i> <span class="smcap">Nora</span> <i>goes over to the ladder.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span>. Wait, Nora, maybe she'd turn back quickly.
She's that sorry, God help her, you wouldn't know the thing
she'd do.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span>. Is she gone round by the bush?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>looking out</i>]. She's gone now. Throw it down
quickly, for the Lord knows when she'll be out of it again.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span> [<i>getting the bundle from the loft</i>]. The young priest
said he'd be passing to-morrow, and we might go down and
speak to him below if it's Michael's they are surely.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>taking the bundle</i>]. Did he say what way they
were found?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span> [<i>coming down</i>]. "There were two men," says he,
"and they rowing round with poteen before the cocks crowed,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page203" name="page203"></a>(p. 203)</span> and the oar of one of them caught the body, and they passing
the black cliffs of the north."</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>trying to open the bundle</i>]. Give me a knife,
Nora, the string's perished with the salt water, and there's a
black knot on it you wouldn't loosen in a week.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span> [<i>giving her a knife</i>]. I've heard tell it was a long way
to Donegal.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>cutting the string</i>]. It is surely. There was
a man in here a while ago&mdash;the man sold us that knife&mdash;and
he said if you set off walking from the rocks beyond, it would
be seven days you'd be in Donegal.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span>. And what time would a man take, and he floating?
[<span class="smcap">Cathleen</span> <i>opens the bundle and takes out a bit of a stocking.
They look at them eagerly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>in a low voice</i>]. The Lord spare us, Nora!
isn't it a queer hard thing to say if it's his they are surely?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span>. I'll get his shirt off the hook the way we can put
the one flannel on the other. [<i>She looks through some clothes
hanging in the corner.</i>] It's not with them, Cathleen, and
where will it be?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span>. I'm thinking Bartley put it on him in the morning,
for his own shirt was heavy with the salt in it. [<i>Pointing
to the corner.</i>] There's a bit of a sleeve was of the same stuff.
Give me that and it will do. [<span class="smcap">Nora</span> <i>brings it to her and they
compare the flannel.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span>. It's the same stuff, Nora; but if it is itself
aren't there great rolls of it in the shops of Galway, and isn't
it many another man may have a shirt of it as well as Michael
himself?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span> [<i>who has taken up the stocking and counted the
stitches, crying out</i>]. It's Michael, Cathleen, it's Michael;
God spare his soul, and what will herself say when she hears
this story, and Bartley on the sea?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>taking the stocking</i>]. It's a plain stocking.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span>. It's the second one of the third pair I knitted, and
I put up three score stitches, and I dropped four of them.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>counts the stitches</i>]. It's that number is in it.
[<i>Crying out.</i>] Ah, Nora, isn't it a bitter thing to think of him
floating that way to the far north, and no one to keen him but
the black hags that do be flying on the sea?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span> [<i>swinging herself round, and throwing out her arms
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page204" name="page204"></a>(p. 204)</span> on the clothes</i>]. And isn't it a pitiful thing when there is nothing
left of a man who was a great rower and fisher, but a bit
of an old shirt and a plain stocking?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>after an instant</i>]. Tell me is herself coming,
Nora? I hear a little sound on the path.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span> [<i>looking out</i>]. She is, Cathleen. She's coming up to
the door.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span>. Put these things away before she'll come in.
Maybe it's easier she'll be after giving her blessing to Bartley,
and we won't let on we've heard anything the time he's on
the sea.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span> [<i>helping</i> <span class="smcap">Cathleen</span> <i>to close the bundle</i>]. We'll put
them here in the corner. [<i>They put them into a hole in the
chimney corner.</i> <span class="smcap">Cathleen</span> <i>goes back to the spinning-wheel.</i></p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span>. Will she see it was crying I was?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span>. Keep your back to the door the way the light'll
not be on you. [<span class="smcap">Nora</span> <i>sits down at the chimney corner, with
her back to the door.</i> <span class="smcap">Maurya</span> <i>comes in very slowly, without
looking at the girls, and goes over to her stool at the other side
of the fire. The cloth with the bread is still in her hand. The
girls look at each other, and</i> <span class="smcap">Nora</span> <i>points to the bundle of
bread.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>after spinning for a moment</i>]. You didn't give
him his bit of bread? [<span class="smcap">Maurya</span> <i>begins to keen softly, without
turning round.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span>. Did you see him riding down? [<span class="smcap">Maurya</span> <i>goes
on keening.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>a little impatiently</i>]. God forgive you; isn't it
a better thing to raise your voice and tell what you seen, than
to be making lamentation for a thing that's done? Did you
see Bartley, I'm saying to you.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span> [<i>with a weak voice</i>]. My heart's broken from this
day.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>as before</i>]. Did you see Bartley?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span>. I seen the fearfulest thing.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>leaves her wheel and looks out</i>]. God forgive
you; he's riding the mare now over the green head, and the
gray pony behind him.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span> [<i>starts, so that her shawl falls back from her head
and shows her white tossed hair. With a frightened voice</i>].
The gray pony behind him.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page205" name="page205"></a>(p. 205)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>coming to the fire</i>]. What is it ails you, at all?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span> [<i>speaking very slowly</i>]. I've seen the fearfulest
thing any person has seen, since the day Bride Dara seen the
dead man with the child in his arms.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen and Nora</span>. Uah. [<i>They crouch down in front
of the old woman at the fire.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span>. Tell us what it is you seen.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span>. I went down to the spring well, and I stood
there saying a prayer to myself. Then Bartley came along, and
he riding on the red mare with the gray pony behind him.
[<i>She puts up her hands, as if to hide something from her eyes.</i>]
The Son of God spare us, Nora!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span>. What is it you seen?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span>. I seen Michael himself.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>speaking softly</i>]. You did not, mother; it
wasn't Michael you seen, for his body is after being found in
the far north, and he's got a clean burial by the grace of God.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span> [<i>a little defiantly</i>]. I'm after seeing him this day,
and he riding and galloping. Bartley came first on the red
mare; and I tried to say "God speed you," but something
choked the words in my throat. He went by quickly; and
"The blessing of God on you," says he, and I could say nothing.
I looked up then, and I crying, at the gray pony, and
there was Michael upon it&mdash;with fine clothes on him, and new
shoes on his feet.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>begins to keen</i>]. It's destroyed we are from
this day. It's destroyed, surely.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span>. Didn't the young priest say the Almighty God
wouldn't leave her destitute with no son living?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span> [<i>in a low voice, but clearly</i>]. It's little the like
of him knows of the sea.... Bartley will be lost now, and
let you call in Eamon and make me a good coffin out of the
white boards, for I won't live after them. I've had a husband,
and a husband's father, and six sons in this house&mdash;six fine
men, though it was a hard birth I had with every one of them
and they coming to the world&mdash;and some of them were found
and some of them were not found, but they're gone now the
lot of them.... There were Stephen, and Shawn, were lost
in the great wind, and found after in the Bay of Gregory of
the Golden Mouth, and carried up the two of them on the
one plank, and in by that door. [<i>She pauses for a moment, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page206" name="page206"></a>(p. 206)</span> girls start as if they heard something through the door that is
half open behind them.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span> [<i>in a whisper</i>]. Did you hear that, Cathleen? Did
you hear a noise in the north-east?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>in a whisper</i>]. There's someone after crying
out by the seashore.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span> [<i>continues without hearing anything</i>]. There was
Sheamus and his father, and his own father again, were lost in
a dark night, and not a stick or sign was seen of them when
the sun went up. There was Patch after was drowned out of
a curagh that turned over. I was sitting here with Bartley,
and he a baby, lying on my two knees, and I seen two women,
and three women, and four women coming in, and they crossing
themselves, and not saying a word. I looked out then,
and there were men coming after them, and they holding a
thing in the half of a red sail, and water dripping out of it&mdash;it
was a dry day, Nora&mdash;and leaving a track to the door.
[<i>She pauses again with her hand stretched out towards the door.
It opens softly and old women begin to come in, crossing themselves
on the threshold, and kneeling down in front of the stage
with red petticoats over their heads.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span> [<i>half in a dream, to</i> <span class="smcap">Cathleen</span>]. Is it Patch, or
Michael, or what is it at all?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span>. Michael is after being found in the far north,
and when he is found there how could he be here in this place?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span>. There does be a power of young men floating
round in the sea, and what way would they know if it was
Michael they had, or another man like him, for when a man
is nine days in the sea, and the wind blowing, it's hard set his
own mother would be to say what man was it.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span>. It's Michael, God spare him, for they're after
sending us a bit of his clothes from the far north. [<i>She reaches
out and hands</i> <span class="smcap">Maurya</span> <i>the clothes that belonged to</i> <span class="smcap">Michael</span>.
<span class="smcap">Maurya</span> <i>stands up slowly, and takes them in her hands.</i>
<span class="smcap">Nora</span> <i>looks out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span>. They're carrying a thing among them and there's
water dripping out of it and leaving a track by the big stones.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>in a whisper to the women who have come in</i>].
Is it Bartley it is?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">One of the Women</span>. It is surely, God rest his soul.
[<i>Two younger women come in and pull out the table. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page207" name="page207"></a>(p. 207)</span> men carry in the body of</i> <span class="smcap">Bartley</span>, <i>laid on a plank, with a bit
of a sail over it, and lay it on the table.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>to the women, as they are doing so</i>]. What
way was he drowned?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">One of the Women</span>. The gray pony knocked him into the
sea, and he was washed out where there is a great surf on the
white rocks. [<span class="smcap">Maurya</span> <i>has gone over and knelt down at the
head of the table. The women are keening softly and swaying
themselves with a slow movement.</i> <span class="smcap">Cathleen</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Nora</span> <i>kneel
at the other end of the table. The men kneel near the door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span> [<i>raising her head and speaking as if she did not
see the people around her</i>]. They're all gone now, and there
isn't anything more the sea can do to me.... I'll have no
call now to be up crying and praying when the wind breaks
from the south, and you can hear the surf is in the east, and
the surf is in the west, making a great stir with the two noises,
and they hitting one on the other. I'll have no call now to be
going down and getting Holy Water in the dark nights after
Samhain, and I won't care what way the sea is when the other
women will be keening. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Nora</span>.] Give me the Holy
Water, Nora, there's a small sup still on the dresser. [<span class="smcap">Nora</span>
<i>gives it to her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span> [<i>drops</i> <span class="smcap">Michael's</span> <i>clothes across</i> <span class="smcap">Bartley's</span> <i>feet,
and sprinkles the Holy Water over him</i>]. It isn't that I
haven't prayed for you, Bartley, to the Almighty God. It isn't
that I haven't said prayers in the dark night till you wouldn't
know what I'ld be saying; but it's a great rest I'll have now,
and it's time surely. It's a great rest I'll have now, and great
sleeping in the long nights after Samhain, if it's only a bit of
wet flour we do have to eat, and maybe a fish that would be
stinking. [<i>She kneels down again, crossing herself, and saying
prayers under her breath.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>to an old man</i>]. Maybe yourself and Eamon
would make a coffin when the sun rises. We have fine white
boards herself bought, God help her, thinking Michael would
be found, and I have a new cake you can eat while you'll be
working.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Old Man</span> [<i>looking at the boards</i>]. Are there nails
with them?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span>. There are not, Colum; we didn't think of the
nails.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page208" name="page208"></a>(p. 208)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Another Man</span>. It's a great wonder she wouldn't think of
the nails, and all the coffins she's seen made already.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span>. It's getting old she is, and broken. [<span class="smcap">Maurya</span>
<i>stands up again very slowly and spreads out the pieces of</i>
<span class="smcap">Michael's</span> <i>clothes beside the body, sprinkling them with the
last of the Holy Water.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Nora</span> [<i>in a whisper to</i> <span class="smcap">Cathleen</span>]. She's quiet now and
easy; but the day Michael was drowned you could hear her
crying out from this to the spring well. It's fonder she was
of Michael, and would anyone have thought that?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Cathleen</span> [<i>slowly and clearly</i>]. An old woman will be
soon tired with anything she will do, and isn't it nine days herself
is after crying and keening, and making great sorrow in
the house?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span> [<i>puts the empty cup mouth downwards on the
table, and lays her hands together on</i> <span class="smcap">Bartley's</span> <i>feet</i>]. They're
all together this time, and the end is come. May the Almighty
God have mercy on Bartley's soul, and on Michael's soul, and
on the souls of Sheamus and Patch, and Stephen and Shawn
[<i>bending her head</i>]; and may He have mercy on my soul,
Nora, and on the soul of everyone is left living in the world.
[<i>She pauses, and the keen rises a little more loudly from the
women, then sinks away.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Maurya</span> [<i>continuing</i>]. Michael has a clean burial in the
far north, by the grace of the Almighty God. Bartley will
have a fine coffin out of the white boards, and a deep grave
surely. What more can we want than that? No man at all
can be living forever, and we must be satisfied. [<i>She kneels
down again and the curtain falls slowly.</i>]</p>

LORD DUNSANY</span></h1>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page211" name="page211"></a>(p. 211)</span> Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett, eighteenth baron
Dunsany, was born in 1878, a lord of the British Empire, heir
to an ancient barony, created by Henry VI in the middle of
the fifteenth century. He went from Eton to Sandhurst, the
English military college, held a lieutenancy in a famous regiment,
the Coldstream Guards, saw active service in the South
African War and served in the Great War as an officer in the
Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers. He turned aside from his career
as a soldier in 1906 to stand for West Wiltshire as the Conservative
candidate, but he was defeated. He writes enthusiastically
always of his interest in sport; he has gone to the ends
of the earth to shoot big game. His first book, <i>The Gods of
Pegana</i>, was published in 1905. He has since written sketches,
fantastic tales, and plays,<a id="footnotetag46" name="footnotetag46"></a><a href="#footnote46" title="Go to footnote 46"><span class="smaller">[46]</span></a> and latterly introductions to the
poems of Francis Ledwidge, the Irish peasant poet, who fell in
battle in 1917. Dunsany's early plays were put on at the
Abbey Theatre where Yeats produced <i>The Glittering Gate</i> in
1909.</p>

<p>The initial American productions were also made in Little
Theatres, under the auspices of the Stage Society of Philadelphia
and at The Neighborhood Playhouse in New York,
where the first performance on any stage of <i>A Night at an Inn</i>
was given on April 22, 1916. It was an immediate success
and aroused great general interest in Dunsany's other
plays. It was remarked at the time that its scene on an English
moor was far from "his own Oriental Never Never
Land," and that it recalled in its substance <i>The Moonstone</i> by
Wilkie Collins and <i>The Mystery of Cloomber</i> by A. Conan
Doyle. Dunsany, unlike the other playwrights associated with
the Irish National Theatre, has borrowed the glamour of the
Orient rather than that of Celtic lore, to heighten his dramatic
effects. There is, in fact, much that is Biblical in his mood
and in his diction.</p>

<p>When, at a later date, Lord Dunsany saw the production of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page212" name="page212"></a>(p. 212)</span> <i>A Night at an Inn</i> at The Neighborhood Playhouse, the effect
of the play "exceeded his own expectations, and he was surprised
to note the thrill which it communicated to his audience.
'It's a very simple thing,' he said,&mdash;'merely a story of some
sailors who have stolen something and know that they are
followed. Possibly it is effective because nearly everybody, at
some time or other, has done something he was sorry for, has
been afraid of retribution, and has felt the hot breath of a pursuing
vengeance on the back of his neck.... <i>A Night at an
Inn</i> was written between tea and dinner in a single sitting.
That was very easy.'"<a id="footnotetag47" name="footnotetag47"></a><a href="#footnote47" title="Go to footnote 47"><span class="smaller">[47]</span></a></p>

<p><i>A Night at an Inn</i> is one of Dunsany's contributions to the
revival of romance in our generation. In an article published
ten years ago, called <i>Romance and the Modern Stage</i>, he wrote:
"Romance is so inseparable from life that all we need, to
obtain romantic drama, is for the dramatist to find any age or
any country where life is not too thickly veiled and cloaked
with puzzles and conventions, in fact to find a people that is
not in the agonies of self-consciousness. For myself, I think
it is simpler to imagine such a people, as it saves the trouble
of reading to find a romantic age, or the trouble of making a
journey to lands where there is no press.... The kind of
drama that we most need to-day seems to me to be the kind
that will build new worlds for the fancy; for the spirit, as
much as the body, needs sometimes a change of scene."</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. 'E's <i>such</i> a toff.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. Yet 'e's clever, no mistake.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. Those clever ones are the beggars to make a
muddle. Their plans are clever enough, but they don't work,
and then they make a mess of things much worse than you
or me.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. Ah!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. I don't like this place.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page214" name="page214"></a>(p. 214)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. Why not?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. I don't like the looks of it.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. He's keeping us here because here those niggers can't
find us. The three heathen priests what was looking for us so.
But we want to go and sell our ruby soon.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. There's no sense in it.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. Why not, Albert?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. Because I gave those black devils the slip in Hull.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. You give 'em the slip, Albert?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. The slip, all three of them. The fellows with the
gold spots on their foreheads. I had the ruby then and I give
them the slip in Hull.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. How did you do it, Albert?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. I had the ruby and they were following me....</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. Who told them you had the ruby? You didn't
show it.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. No.... But they kind of know.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. They kind of know, Albert?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. Yes, they know if you've got it. Well, they sort
of mouched after me, and I tells a policeman and he says, O,
they were only three poor niggers and they wouldn't hurt me.
Ugh! When I thought of what they did in Malta to poor
old Jim.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. Yes, and to George in Bombay before we started.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. Ugh!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. Why didn't you give 'em in charge?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. What about the ruby, Bill?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. Ah!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. Well, I did better than that. I walks up and
down through Hull. I walks slow enough. And then I turns
a corner and I runs. I never sees a corner but I turns it. But
sometimes I let a corner pass just to fool them. I twists about
like a hare. Then I sits down and waits. No priests.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. What?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. No heathen black devils with gold spots on their
face. I give 'em the slip.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. Well done, Albert!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span> [<i>after a sigh of content</i>]. Why didn't you tell us?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. 'Cause 'e won't let you speak. 'E's got 'is plans
and 'e thinks we're silly folk. Things must be done 'is way.
And all the time I've give 'em the slip. Might 'ave 'ad one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page215" name="page215"></a>(p. 215)</span> o' them crooked knives in him before now but for me who give
'em the slip in Hull.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. Well done, Albert! Do you hear that, Toffy?
Albert has give 'em the slip.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Yes, I hear.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. Well, what do you say to that?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. O.... Well done, Albert!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. And what a' you going to do?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Going to wait.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. Don't seem to know what 'e's waiting for.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. It's a nasty place.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. It's getting silly, Bill. Our money's gone and we
want to sell the ruby. Let's get on to a town.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. But 'e won't come.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. Then we'll leave him.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. We'll be all right if we keep away from Hull.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. We'll go to London.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. But 'e must 'ave 'is share.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. All right. Only let's go. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">The Toff</span>.]
We're going, do you hear? Give us the ruby.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Certainly. [<i>He gives them a ruby from his
waistcoat pocket; it is the size of a small hen's egg. He goes
on reading his paper.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. Come on, Sniggers. [<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Albert</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Sniggers</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. Good-by, old man. We'll give you your fair share,
but there's nothing to do here&mdash;no girls, no halls, and we must
sell the ruby.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. I'm not a fool, Bill.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. No, no, of course not. Of course you ain't, and
you've helped us a lot. Good-by. You'll say good-by?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Oh, yes. Good-by. [<i>Still reads his paper.
Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Bill</span>. <span class="smcap">The Toff</span> <i>puts a revolver on the table beside him
and goes on with his papers. After a moment the three men
come rushing in again, frightened.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span> [<i>out of breath</i>]. We've come back, Toffy.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. So you have.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. Toffy.... How did they get here?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. They walked, of course.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. But it's eighty miles.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. Did you know they were here, Toffy?</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page216" name="page216"></a>(p. 216)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Expected them about now.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. Eighty miles!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. Toffy, old man ... what are we to do?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Ask Albert.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. If they can do things like this, there's no one can save
us but you, Toffy.... I always knew you were a clever
one. We won't be fools any more. We'll obey you, Toffy.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. You're brave enough and strong enough. There
isn't many that would steal a ruby eye out of an idol's head,
and such an idol as that was to look at, and on such a night.
You're brave enough, Bill. But you're all three of you fools.
Jim would have none of my plans, and where's Jim? And
George. What did they do to him?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. Don't, Toffy!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Well, then, your strength is no use to you.
You want cleverness; or they'll have you the way they had
George and Jim.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">All</span>. Ugh!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Those black priests would follow you round
the world in circles. Year after year, till they got the idol's
eye. And if we died with it, they'd follow our grandchildren.
That fool thinks he can escape from men like that by running
round three streets in the town of Hull.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. God's truth, <i>you</i> 'aven't escaped them, because
they're <i>'ere</i>.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. So I supposed.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. You <i>supposed</i>!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Yes, I believe there's no announcement in the
Society papers. But I took this country seat especially to receive
them. There's plenty of room if you dig, it is pleasantly
situated, and, what is more important, it is in a very quiet
neighborhood. So I am at home to them this afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. Well, <i>you're</i> a deep one.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. And remember, you've only my wits between
you and death, and don't put your futile plans against those of
an educated gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. If you're a gentleman, why don't you go about
among gentlemen instead of the likes of us?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Because I was too clever for them as I am too
clever for you.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. Too clever for them?</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page217" name="page217"></a>(p. 217)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. I never lost a game of cards in my life.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. You never lost a game?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Not when there was money in it.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. Well, well!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Have a game of poker?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">All</span>. No, thanks.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Then do as you're told.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. All right, Toffy.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. I saw something just then. Hadn't we better
draw the curtains?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. What?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Don't draw the curtains.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. O, all right.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. But, Toffy, they can see us. One doesn't let the
enemy do that. I don't see why....</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. No, of course you don't.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. O, all right, Toffy. [<i>All begin to pull out revolvers.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span> [<i>putting his own away</i>]. No revolvers, please.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. Why not?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Because I don't want any noise at my party.
We might get guests that hadn't been invited. <i>Knives</i> are a
different matter. [<i>All draw knives.</i> <span class="smcap">The Toff</span> <i>signs to them
not to draw them yet.</i> <span class="smcap">Toffy</span> <i>has already taken back his
ruby.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. I think they're coming, Toffy.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Not yet.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. When will they come?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. When I am quite ready to receive them. Not
before.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. I should like to get this over.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Should you? Then we'll have them now.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. Now?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Yes. Listen to me. You shall do as you see
me do. You will all pretend to go out. I'll show you how.
I've got the ruby. When they see me alone they will come for
their idol's eye.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. How can they tell like this which of us has it?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. I confess I don't know, but they seem to.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. What will you do when they come in?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. I shall do nothing.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page218" name="page218"></a>(p. 218)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. What?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. They will creep up behind me. Then, my
friends, Sniggers and Bill and Albert, who gave them the slip,
will do what they can.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. All right, Toffy. Trust us.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. If you're a little slow, you will see enacted the
cheerful spectacle that accompanied the demise of Jim.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. Don't, Toffy. We'll be there, all right.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Very well. Now watch me. [<i>He goes past
the windows to the inner door R. He opens it inwards, then

We must attract another guest.... Now, are you ready?</p>

window and stays for some time. Then the door opens and,
looking craftily round, the third Priest enters. He looks at his
companions' bodies and turns round. He suspects something.

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Come on, Bill. [<i>The Priest rushes to the
door.</i> <span class="smcap">The Toff</span> <i>knifes the last Priest from behind.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. A good day's work, my friends.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. Well done, Toffy. Oh, you are a deep one!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. A deep one if ever there was one.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. There ain't any more, Bill, are there?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. No more in the world, my friend.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. Aye, that's all there are. There were only three in
the temple. Three priests and their beastly idol.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. What is it worth, Toffy? Is it worth a thousand
pounds?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. It's worth all they've got in the shop. Worth
just whatever we like to ask for it.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. Then we're millionaires now.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Yes, and, what is more important, we no longer
have any heirs.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. We'll have to sell it now.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. That won't be easy. It's a pity it isn't small and
we had half a dozen. Hadn't the idol any other on him?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. No, he was green jade all over and only had this one
eye. He had it in the middle of his forehead and was a long
sight uglier than anything else in the world.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. I'm sure we ought all to be very grateful to Toffy.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. And, indeed, we ought.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. If it hadn't been for him....</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. Yes, if it hadn't been for old Toffy....</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. He's a deep one.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Well, you see I just have a knack of foreseeing
things.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. I should think you did.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. Why, I don't suppose anything happens that our Toff
doesn't foresee. Does it, Toffy?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Well, I don't think it does, Bill. I don't think
it often does.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. Life is no more than just a game of cards to our
old Toff.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Well, we've taken these fellows' trick.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span> [<i>going to window</i>]. It wouldn't do for anyone
to see them.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page221" name="page221"></a>(p. 221)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Oh, nobody will come this way. We're all
alone on a moor.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. Where will we put them?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Bury them in the cellar, but there's no hurry.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. And what then, Toffy?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Why, then we'll go to London and upset the
ruby business. We have really come through this job very
nicely.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. I think the first thing that we ought to do is to give
a little supper to old Toffy. We'll bury these fellows to-night.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. Yes, let's.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. The very thing!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. And we'll all drink his health.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. Good old Toffy!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. He ought to have been a general or a premier.
[<i>They get bottles from cupboard, etc.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Well, we've earned our bit of a supper. [<i>They
sit down.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span> [<i>glass in hand</i>]. Here's to old Toffy, who guessed
everything!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Sniggers</span>. Good old Toffy!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Sniggers</span>. Hear! Hear!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. And here's to Bill, who saved me twice to-night.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. Couldn't have done it but for your cleverness, Toffy.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. Hear, hear! Hear! Hear!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. He foresees everything.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. A speech, Toffy. A speech from our general.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">All</span>. Yes, a speech.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. A speech.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Well, get me some water. This whisky's too
much for my head, and I must keep it clear till our friends
are safe in the cellar.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. Water? Yes, of course. Get him some water,
Sniggers.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. We don't use water here. Where shall I get it?</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page222" name="page222"></a>(p. 222)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Hullo, here's Jacob Smith, Esquire, J. P., alias
Sniggers, back again.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. Toffy, I've been thinking about my share in that
ruby. I don't want it, Toffy; I don't want it.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Nonsense, Sniggers. Nonsense.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. You shall have it, Toffy, you shall have it yourself,
only say Sniggers has no share in this 'ere ruby. Say it,
Toffy, say it!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Bill</span>. Want to turn informer, Sniggers?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. No, no. Only I don't want the ruby, Toffy....</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. No more nonsense, Sniggers. We're all in
together in this. If one hangs, we all hang; but they won't
outwit me. Besides, it's not a hanging affair, they had their
knives.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. Toffy, Toffy, I always treated you fair, Toffy.
I was always one to say, Give Toffy a chance. Take back my
share, Toffy.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. What's the matter? What are you driving at?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. Take it back, Toffy.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. Answer me, what are you up to?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. I don't want my share any more.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. No, no knives, Albert.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Albert</span>. What then?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Toff</span>. The honest truth in open court, barring the

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Sniggers</span>. There's no police.</p>

STARK YOUNG</span></h1>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page226" name="page226"></a>(p. 226)</span> Stark Young, dramatist and critic, the author of <i>The Twilight
Saint</i>, was born in Como, Mississippi, on October 11,
1881. He was graduated from the university of his native
state and a year later took his master's degree at Columbia
University. From 1907 to 1915 he taught at the University
of Texas, and from 1915 to 1921 he was professor of English
at Amherst College. His travels have taken him to Greece,
and to Spain, and to Italy where he has lingered, making a
special study of the native drama.</p>

<p>The text of <i>The Twilight Saint</i> has undergone revision by
the author since its first appearance. It was acted in 1918 with
<i>Madretta</i>, another of the author's plays, at the dramatic school
of the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, under
the direction of Thomas Wood Stevens. The author writes:
"The only instruction I should like to propose is that the
actor of St. Francis keep him very simple, not get him moralizing
and long-faced. In Egan's book on St. Francis<a id="footnotetag49" name="footnotetag49"></a><a href="#footnote49" title="Go to footnote 49"><span class="smaller">[49]</span></a> there is
a picture of the preaching to the birds in which Boutet de
Monvel shows a Tuscan type that is my idea of the man simplified."
The play itself suggests charming by-ways of literature
that lead in one direction perhaps to Hewlett's <i>Earthwork
Out of Tuscany</i> and Josephine Preston Peabody's <i>The Wolf
of Gubbio</i>, and in another possibly to the Saint's own <i>Little
Flowers</i>, and <i>Canticle to the Sun</i>.</p>

Shut in this house from month to month a nurse;<br>
Here lies she sick, this child, and may not stir;<br>
And I, lacking due means to hire, must serve<br>
The house; while my best self, my soul, my art,<br>
Rust. My soul is scorched with holy thirst,<br>
My temples throb, my veins run fire; but yet,<br>
For all my dim distress and vague desire,<br>
No word, no single song, no verse, has come&mdash;<br>
O Blessed God!&mdash;stifled with creature needs,<br>
And with necessity about my throat!</p>

Thy corner is too hot, the glaring sun<br>
Is yet on the wall.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Guido</span>.<br>
'Tis not that sun that maddens me, O Pia!<br>
Can you not see me shrunk? Have you not heard<br>
That other Guido of Perugia<br>
How he is grown? How lately at the feast<br>
That Ugolino, the great cardinal,<br>
Spread at Assisi Easter night, Guido<br>
Read certain of his verses and declaimed<br>
Pages of cursed sonnets to the guests.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Pia</span>.<br>
Young Guido of Perugia, thy friend?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Guido</span>.<br>
Yea. And when he ended, came the Duke<br>
Down from the dais to kiss that Guido's hand<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page229" name="page229"></a>(p. 229)</span> Humbly, and said that poesy was king.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Pia</span>.<br>
Madonna, kissed by the Duke!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Guido</span>.<br>
And I, O God, I might have honor too<br>
Could I but break this prison where I drudge!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Pia</span>.<br>
Speak low, her sleep is light. Her road is hard<br>
As well as thine. For all this year, since thou<br>
Didst bring her to Rieto here to us,<br>
Hath she lain on her bed, broken with pain,<br>
This child that is thy wife and loveth thee.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Guido</span>.<br>
Aye, yes, 'tis true, she loveth me, she loveth me,<br>
And I love her. 'Tis worse&mdash;add grief to care,<br>
And Poesy fares worse.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Pia</span>.<br>
And she is grown most pale and still of late.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Guido</span>.<br>
Look, Pia, how she lieth there like death,<br>
That far-off patience on her face. Now, now,<br>
Surely I needs must make a song! And yet<br>
I may not; ashes and floor-sweeping clog<br>
My soul within me!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Pia</span>.<br>
Nay, let thy dreams pass. Look thou, how pale!<br>
Dear Lord, how blue her little veins do shine!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Guido</span>.<br>
Thou art most kind, good neighbor, to come here<br>
Helping our house. And it is very strange<br>
That when we are so kind we cannot know<br>
The heart also. For in my soul I hear<br>
A bell summoning me always&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Pia</span>.<br>
If I should stew in milk the peas, maybe&mdash;<br>
Do you think the child would eat it?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Guido</span>.<br>
For thy world is not my world, kind old friend.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Pia</span>.<br>

I have an hour yet.</p>

I will come back soon enough to my chores, be sure;<br>
Mine is a short tether.</p>

Pia, turn my pillow, I am stifled.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Pia</span>.<br>
There! Thou hast slept well?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Lisetta</span>.<br>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Pia</span>.<br>
Holy Virgin, thou hast not slept!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Lisetta</span>.<br>
Pia, think you I did not know? This month<br>
I scarce have slept for thinking on his lot.<br>
I read his fighting soul. Where are his songs,<br>
The great renown that waited him? Down, down,<br>
Struck by the self-same hand that shattered me.<br>
I listen night on night and hear him moan<br>
In his sleep&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Pia</span>.<br>
It is his love for thee, Lisetta.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Lisetta</span>.<br>
The padre from the village hemmed and said<br>
That God had sent me and my sickness here<br>
For Guido's cross to bear, his scourge. They thought<br>
I slept&mdash;</p>

Thou hast dreamed this, he loveth thee, Lisetta.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Lisetta</span>.<br>
Yea, loveth me somewhat but glory more.<br>
And I would have it so. O Mother of God,<br>
When wilt thou send me death? O Blessed Mother,<br>
I have lain so still!</p>

And round him came the birds, beating their wings<br>
Upon his cloak and lighting on his arm.<br>
I saw him smile on them and heard him speak!<br>
"My brother birds, little brothers, ye should love God<br>
Who gave you your wings and your bright songs and spread<br>
The soft air for you." He stroked their necks<br>
And blessed them. And then I saw his eyes.<br>
"Father," I cried, "speak thou to me, I faint<br>
Beside my way!"</p>

Hath given thee thy soul for its own life,<br>
And not for glory among men."</p>

Guido!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Guido</span>.<br>

How God had magnified my soul through him,<br>
And sent me peace. And I returned to thee;<br>
For here in thee have I my glory.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Lisetta</span>.<br>
Guido, the old spring comes back again. And now<br>
I may speak. Guido, look through my window vines there<br>
Where the stars rise. O Love, I have not slept<br>
For lacking thee. And often have I seen<br>
The moonlight lie like sleep upon the hill,<br>
And in the garden of the sky the moon<br>
Drift like a blown rose, Guido, and yet<br>
I might not speak.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Guido</span>.<br>
Thou art my saint and shrine!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Lisetta</span>.<br>
Now shall my dream become thy song again,<br>
And the long twilight be more sweet, Guido!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Guido</span>.<br>
I pray thee rest thee now and sleep. Good-night.<br>
My full heart breaks in song; and I will sit<br>
Hearing the blessed saints within my soul,<br>
And will not stir from thee lest thou shouldst wake<br>
When I might not be near to serve thy need.</p>

Thus night has fallen on a tender heart<br>

Queen Sorrow, who can hide the stars of heaven,<br>
Has torn the golden veil from top to hem,<br>

Seeing no rift to tell of light eclipsed,<br>
Knowing no key to all the mystery.</p>

Had turned thy heart to unresponsive stone.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Douce-c&oelig;ur</span>.<br>
She brought me peace and sure oblivion<br>
Of all this dark and weary world around.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Love</span>.<br>
Art thou so sure, Princess, the world is dark?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Douce-c&oelig;ur</span>.<br>
So sure? Have I not heard the children weep?<br>
Is not my heart torn with their piteous cries?<br>
We live, and round us lies their sea of tears,<br>
A mighty sea that could engulf a realm.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Love</span>.<br>
I met a Child outside thy Palace once.<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page257" name="page257"></a>(p. 257)</span> His dress was ragged, but he smiled at me,<br>
And in his hand he held a purple flower.<br>
I knew it for the magic flower of Dream.<br>
I asked him "Art thou happy?" and he said<br>
"I'm mostly hungry; sometimes I am cold;<br>
And there are stones and thorns that hurt my feet,<br>
But while my Flower lives I am quite content.<br>
And I have friends too, in the Palace there;<br>
Laughter and Dance they come and play with me."<br>
I met that Child to-day, Princess. His face<br>
Was white and pinched, and down his baby cheeks<br>
The tears were running, "See, my Flower has died,<br>
And Dance and Laughter have been sent away.<br>
Joy too is gone. Queen Sorrow reigns at Court."<br>
Even the children now can play no more.<br>
He never knew before the world was dark.<br>
Art thou so sure, Princess, the Child was wrong?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Douce-c&oelig;ur</span>.<br>
Have I not heard bereavèd mothers weep?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Love</span>.<br>
There thou dost touch a chord in ignorance.<br>
Thou canst not guess the strength of Motherhood,<br>
The hopes, the joys, the passionate regrets.<br>
She who has borne her child close to her heart<br>
Has lit a star in Heaven that lights her way.<br>
I kneel by them in their Gethsemane<br>
And teach them how to weave immortal wreaths<br>
Out of the sweetest flowers of Memory;<br>
For them the sun still shines behind the clouds,<br>
Art thou so sure the world is wholly dark?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Douce-c&oelig;ur</span>.<br>
There echo in my ears the groans of Toil,<br>
Of those who labor on from year to year<br>
Until they sink beneath their weary lot.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Love</span>.<br>
Toil is the destiny of man, Princess,<br>
And none may question the Supreme Decree.<br>
Perchance through toil alone man may redeem<br>
A past that is forgotten. Who can tell?<br>
And there is still some aftermath of joy<br>
In labor well achieved, some dignity<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page258" name="page258"></a>(p. 258)</span> In toil accomplished. If the way is hard<br>
And seeming endless, those who seek for me<br>
Will often find me singing at their side.<br>
Mine is the Brotherhood of Sympathy.<br>
But thou hast banished Song, in silence now<br>
The toilers have to go upon their way.<br>
Art thou so sure, it was all dark before?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Douce-c&oelig;ur</span>.<br>
What light is there for those who strive and fail?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Love</span>.<br>
One only fails. He whom some term Success,<br>
He who gives heart and soul and youth and strength<br>
To an unworthy cause. Failure is he<br>
Who sacrifices me before the world,<br>
Who prostitutes the God in him for what<br>
Will turn to dust and ashes in his hand.<br>
'Tis he alone is outcast though he thinks<br>
Himself the sun of all the universe.<br>
To those, Princess, who striving seem to fail,<br>
It is not failure, for none see the end,<br>
And they who sigh are only those who seek<br>
An earlier consummation than is just;<br>
If they cling fast to me they still behold<br>
The white star-flowers Hope plants about the world.<br>
Who knows to what fair land rough seas may lead?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Douce-c&oelig;ur</span>.<br>
Lo! over all I see the cruel hand<br>
Of Death outstretched, certain and pitiless.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Love</span>.<br>
The hand of Death is full of tenderness.<br>
He leads men through that dark mysterious gate&mdash;<br>
That all must pass into another life&mdash;<br>
To other lives that through the cycles bring<br>
The souls of men upward from step to step,<br>
Uniting those for ever who are one.<br>
Death hushes them like children on his breast.<br>
Setting his own smile on their silent lips&mdash;<br>
That tender smile of strange triumphant peace.<br>
Death is my Brother, and I say to thee,<br>
Learn to know me, thou wilt not fear his hand.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page259" name="page259"></a>(p. 259)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Douce-c&oelig;ur</span>.<br>
Another hand is knocking at my heart<br>
Whose touch I know not, and I feel afraid&mdash;<br>
Afraid to listen. Yet I long to hear.<br>
Stranger, who art thou? Let me see thy face.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Love</span>.<br>
Learn to know me and thou shalt nothing fear.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Douce-c&oelig;ur</span>.<br>
Who art thou? Let me look into thine eyes.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Love</span>.<br>

Pilgrim, who art thou? Let me know thy name.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Love</span>.<br>
Dost thou not know me, Douce-c&oelig;ur?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Douce-c&oelig;ur</span> [<i>slowly</i>].<br>
Thou art Love!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Love</span>.<br>
And dost thou know the meaning of my name?<br>
Tell me thou art not fearful any more.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Douce-c&oelig;ur</span>.<br>
The darkness that was bound about mine eyes<br>
Is falling from me. In the growing light<br>
The answer to Life's riddle is made clear.<br>
I seem to stand upon a height, caught up<br>
In ecstasy of rapture near the sun.<br>
The day is dawning; far before my eyes<br>
I see the earth spread out there like a map.<br>
Shadow and sunshine traveling on the road<br>
O'ertake each other, mingle&mdash;and are one.</p>

And ease the burden man has laid on man.<br>

<h1><span class="pagenum"><a id="page263" name="page263"></a>(p. 263)</span> THE INTRUDER<br>
<span class="smaller">By<br>
MAURICE MAETERLINCK</span></h1>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page265" name="page265"></a>(p. 265)</span> Maurice Polydore Marie Bernard Maeterlinck, to give him
his full baptismal name, was born in Ghent on August 29,
1862. He was sent to the Jesuit College de Sainte-Barbe, the
institution which another great Belgian, Emile Verhaeren, also
attended. In 1885, Maeterlinck entered the University of
Ghent to study law, but his practice of this profession was confined
to a scant year or two. Maeterlinck's chief interest in
his college years seems to have been the modern movement in
Belgian literature. But the frequency of his visits to Paris increased
in the years between 1886 and 1896, and finally in the
latter year he settled there.</p>

<p>The following word picture supplements the photographs of
Maeterlinck that are so frequently reproduced in our magazines
and newspapers: "Maeterlinck is easily described: a man
of about five feet nine in height, inclined to be stout; silver
hair lends distinction to the large round head and boyish fresh
complexion; blue-gray eyes, now thoughtful, now merry, and
an unaffected off-hand manner. The features are not cut, left
rather 'in the rough,' as sculptors say, even the heavy jaw and
chin are drowned in fat; the forehead bulges and the eyes lose
color in the light and seem hard; still, an interesting and attractive
personality."</p>

<p>Maeterlinck's fame rests on his poetry and his essays no less
than on his plays. <i>L'Intruse</i>, <i>The Intruder</i>, reprinted here,
belongs to the early years of his activity as a playwright. It
was printed in 1890 in a Belgian periodical, <i>La Wallonie</i>, and
was acted for the first time a year later at Paul Fort's Théâtre
d'Art in Paris, at a performance given for the benefit of the
poet, Paul Verlaine, and the painter, Paul Gauguin. Maeterlinck,
though publishing volumes of essays from time to time,
continues to write for the theatre.<a id="footnotetag52" name="footnotetag52"></a><a href="#footnote52" title="Go to footnote 52"><span class="smaller">[52]</span></a> In 1908 <i>The Blue Bird</i>,
dramatizing the quest for Truth, one of the most popular of
modern plays, was given for the first time in Moscow, to be
followed ten years later by the première in New York of a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page266" name="page266"></a>(p. 266)</span> sequel, <i>The Betrothal</i>, similarly dramatizing the search for
Beauty. In 1910 came his translation of <i>Macbeth</i> into French.
A year later he was awarded the Nobel prize for literature.</p>

<p><i>The Intruder</i>, the theme of which is the mysterious coming
of death, is an illustration of one of Maeterlinck's pet theories
in regard to the subject matter of the drama. He expresses it
in this way in his famous essay on <i>The Tragic in Daily Life</i>:
"An old man, seated in his armchair, waiting patiently with
his lamp beside him&mdash;submitting with bent head to the presence
of his soul and his destiny&mdash;motionless as he is, does yet live
in reality a deeper, more human, more universal life than ...
the captain who conquers in battle." To plays based on this
theory has been given the name "static drama." <i>The Intruder</i>
illustrates also Maeterlinck's use of symbols. The Grandfather
in the play is blind, for instance; blind characters in
Maeterlinck's plays are symbols of the spiritual blindness of the
human race; the gardener sharpening his scythe stands for
death; the mysterious quenching of the lamp&mdash;it may have gone
out because there was no oil in it&mdash;signifies the going out of life.</p>

<p>The problem in the staging of this play is the "creation of
a mood or atmosphere, rather than the unfolding of an
action." One of the settings used in this country is here
reproduced. It was designed for the Arts &amp; Crafts Theatre
of Detroit. Sheldon Cheney, whose description of Sam
Hume's plastic units for the stage of this Little Theatre is
given in the Introduction on page xxxi, has described the rearrangement
of this equipment and the additions that can be
made to it for the production of this play as follows: "For
Maeterlinck's <i>The Intruder</i>, which demanded a room in an
old château, one important addition was made, a flat with a
door. At the left was the arch, then a pylon and curtain, and
then the Gothic window with practicable casements added.
The rest of the back wall was made up of the new door-piece
flanked by curtains, while the third wall consisted of two pylons
and curtains. Stairs and platforms were utilized before the
window and under the arch. A small two-stair unit was added,
leading to the new door. This arrangement afforded exactly
that suggestion of spaciousness and mystery for which the play
calls." When the play was given at the Independent Theatre
in London in 1895, it was played behind a blue gauze curtain.</p>

<p>On one of Maeterlinck's visits to London, he was taken by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page267" name="page267"></a>(p. 267)</span> Alfred Sutro, the dramatist, to call on Barrie in his flat at the
Adelphi. Maeterlinck was asked to write his name on the
whitewashed wall of Barrie's studio. He did so and added
above the signature: "<i>Au père de Peter Pan, et au grandpère
de L'Oiseau Bleu.</i>"</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. I don't look at these things as you
others do.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. You ought to rely on us, then, who can see.
She looked very well this afternoon. She is sleeping quietly
now; and we are not going to spoil, without any reason, the
first comfortable evening that luck has thrown in our way....
It seems to me we have a perfect right to be easy, and
even to laugh a little, this evening, without apprehension.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. That's true; this is the first time I have felt
at home with my family since this terrible confinement.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. When once illness has come into a house, it
is as though a stranger had forced himself into the family
circle.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. And then you understood, too, that you
should count on no one outside the family.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. You are quite right.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. Why could I not see my poor
daughter to-day?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. You know quite well&mdash;the doctor forbade it.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. I do not know what to think....</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. It is absurd to worry.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span> [<i>pointing to the door on the left</i>]. She
cannot hear us?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. We shall not talk too loud; besides, the door
is very thick, and the Sister of Mercy is with her, and she is
sure to warn us if we are making too much noise.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span> [<i>pointing to the door on the right</i>].
He cannot hear us?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. No, no.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. He is asleep?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. I suppose so.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. Someone had better go and see.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. The little one would cause <i>me</i> more anxiety
than your wife. It is now several weeks since he was born,
and he has scarcely stirred. He has not cried once all the
time! He is like a wax doll.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. I think he will be deaf&mdash;dumb too,
perhaps&mdash;the usual result of a marriage between cousins....
[<i>A reproving silence.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. I could almost wish him ill for the suffering
he has caused his mother.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page270" name="page270"></a>(p. 270)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. Do be reasonable; it is not the poor little
thing's fault. He is quite alone in the room?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. Yes; the doctor does not wish him to stay
in his mother's room any longer.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. But the nurse is with him?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. No; she has gone to rest a little; she has
well deserved it these last few days. Ursula, just go and see
if he is asleep.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Eldest Daughter</span>. Yes, father. [<span class="smcap">The Three

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. When will your sister come?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. I think she will come about nine.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. It is past nine. I hope she will come this
evening, my wife is so anxious to see her.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. She is certain to come. This will be the first
time she has been here?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. She has never been into the house.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. It is very difficult for her to leave her convent.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. Will she be alone?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. I expect one of the nuns will come with her.
They are not allowed to go out alone.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. But she is the Superior.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. The rule is the same for all.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. Do you not feel anxious?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. Why should we feel anxious? What's the
good of harping on that? There is nothing more to fear.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. Your sister is older than you?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. She is the eldest of us all.</p>

uneasy. I wish your sister were here.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. I think someone has come into the garden,
grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. Who is it?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. I do not know; I can see no one.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. Because there is no one there.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. There must be someone in the garden;
the nightingales have suddenly ceased singing.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. But I do not hear anyone coming.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. Someone must be passing by the pond,
because the swans are scared.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Another Daughter</span>. All the fishes in the pond are diving
suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. You cannot see anyone?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. No one, father.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. But the pond lies in the moonlight....</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. Yes; I can see that the swans are scared.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. I am sure it is my sister who is scaring them.
She must have come in by the little gate.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. I cannot understand why the dogs do not
bark.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. I can see the watch-dog right at the back
of his kennel. The swans are crossing to the other bank!...</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. They are afraid of my sister. I will go and
see. [<i>He calls.</i>] Sister! sister! Is that you?... There
is no one there.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page272" name="page272"></a>(p. 272)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. I am sure that someone has come into
the garden. You will see.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. But she would answer me!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. Are not the nightingales beginning to
sing again, Ursula?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. I cannot hear one anywhere.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. And yet there is no noise.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. There is a silence of the grave.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. It must be some stranger that scares
them, for if it were one of the family they would not be
silent.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. How much longer are you going to discuss
these nightingales.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. Are all the windows open, Ursula?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. The glass door is open, grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. It seems to me that the cold is penetrating
into the room.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. There is a little wind in the garden,
grandfather, and the rose-leaves are falling.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. Well, shut the door. It is late.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. Yes, father.... I cannot shut the door.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Two Other Daughters</span>. We cannot shut the door.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. Why, what is the matter with the
door, my children?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. You need not say that in such an extraordinary
voice. I will go and help them.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Eldest Daughter</span>. We cannot manage to shut it
quite.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. It is because of the damp. Let us all push
together. There must be something in the way.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. The carpenter will set it right to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. Is the carpenter coming to-morrow?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. Yes, grandfather; he is coming to do some
work in the cellar.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. He will make a noise in the house.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. I will tell him to work quietly. [<i>Suddenly
the sound of a scythe being sharpened is heard outside.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span> [<i>with a shudder</i>]. Oh!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. What is that?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. I don't quite know; I think it is the gardener.
I cannot quite see; he is in the shadow of the house.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page273" name="page273"></a>(p. 273)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. It is the gardener going to mow.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. He mows by night?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. Is not to-morrow Sunday?&mdash;Yes.&mdash;I noticed
that the grass was very long round the house.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. It seems to me that his scythe makes
as much noise ...</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. He is mowing near the house.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. Can you see him, Ursula?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. No, grandfather. He stands in the dark.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. I am afraid he will wake my daughter.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. We can scarcely hear him.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. It sounds to me as if he were mowing
inside the house.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. The invalid will not hear it; there is no
danger.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. It seems to me that the lamp is not burning
well this evening.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. It wants filling.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. I saw it filled this morning. It has burnt
badly since the window was shut.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. I fancy the chimney is dirty.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. It will burn better presently.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. Grandfather is asleep. He has not slept
for three nights.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. He has been so much worried.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. He always worries too much. At times he
will not listen to reason.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. It is quite excusable at his age.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. God knows what we shall be like at his age!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. He is nearly eighty.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. Then he has a right to be strange.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. He is like all blind people.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. They think too much.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. They have too much time to spare.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. They have nothing else to do.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. And, besides, they have no distractions.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. That must be terrible.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. Apparently one gets used to it.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. I cannot imagine it.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. They are certainly to be pitied.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. Not to know where one is, not to know where
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page274" name="page274"></a>(p. 274)</span> one has come from, not to know whither one is going, not to
be able to distinguish midday from midnight, or summer from
winter&mdash;and always darkness, darkness! I would rather not
live. Is it absolutely incurable?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. Apparently so.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. But he is not absolutely blind?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. He can perceive a strong light.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. Let us take care of our poor eyes.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. He often has strange ideas.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. At times he is not at all amusing.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. He says absolutely everything he thinks.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. But he was not always like this?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. No; once he was as rational as we are; he
never said anything extraordinary. I am afraid Ursula encourages
him a little too much; she answers all his questions....</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. It would be better not to answer them. It's
a mistaken kindness to him. [<i>Ten o'clock strikes.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span> [<i>waking up</i>]. Am I facing the glass
door?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. You have had a nice sleep, grandfather?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. Am I facing the glass door?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. Yes, grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. There is nobody at the glass door?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. No, grandfather; I do not see anyone.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. I thought someone was waiting. No
one has come?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. No one, grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span> [<i>to the</i> <span class="smcap">Uncle</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Father</span>]. And
your sister has not come?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. It is too late; she will not come now. It is
not nice of her.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. I'm beginning to be anxious about her. [<i>A
noise, as of someone coming into the house.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. She is here! Did you hear?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. Yes; someone has come in at the basement.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. It must be our sister. I recognized her step.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. I heard slow footsteps.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. She came in very quietly.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. She knows there is an invalid.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. I hear nothing now.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page275" name="page275"></a>(p. 275)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. She will come up directly; they will tell her
we are here.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. I am glad she has come.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. I was sure she would come this evening.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. She is a very long time coming up.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. However, it must be she.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. We are not expecting any other visitors.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. I cannot hear any noise in the basement.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. I will call the servant. We shall know how
things stand. [<i>He pulls a bell-rope.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. I can hear a noise on the stairs already.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. It is the servant coming up.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. It sounds to me as if she were not
alone.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. She is coming up slowly....</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. I hear your sister's step!<7p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. I can only hear the servant.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. It is your sister! It is your sister!</p>

<p><span class="min1em">[<i>There is a knock at the little door.</i>]</span></p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. She is knocking at the door of the back stairs.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. I will go and open myself. [<i>He partly opens
the little door;</i> <span class="smcap">The Servant</span> <i>remains outside in the opening.</i>]
Where are you?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Servant</span>. Here, sir.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. Your sister is at the door?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. I can only see the servant.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. It is only the servant. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">The Servant</span>.]
Who was that, that came into the house?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Servant</span>. Came into the house?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. Yes; someone came in just now?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Servant</span>. No one came in, sir.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. Who is it sighing like that?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. It is the servant; she is out of breath.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. Is she crying?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. No; why should she be crying?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span> [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">The Servant</span>]. No one came in just
now?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Servant</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. But we heard someone open the door!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Servant</span>. It was I shutting the door.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page276" name="page276"></a>(p. 276)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. It was open?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Servant</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. Why was it open at this time of night?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Servant</span>. I do not know, sir. I had shut it myself.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. Then who was it that opened it?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Servant</span>. I do not know, sir. Someone must have
gone out after me, sir....</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. You must be careful.&mdash;Don't push the door;
you know what a noise it makes!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Servant</span>. But, sir, I am not touching the door.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. But you are. You are pushing as if you
were trying to get into the room.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Servant</span>. But, sir, I am three yards away from the
door.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. Don't talk so loud....</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. Are they putting out the light?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Eldest Daughter</span>. No, grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. It seems to me it has grown pitch
dark all at once.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span> [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">The Servant</span>]. You can go down again
now; but do not make so much noise on the stairs.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Servant</span>. I did not make any noise on the stairs.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. I tell you that you did make a noise. Go
down quietly; you will wake your mistress. And if anyone
comes now, say that we are not at home.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. Yes; say that we are not at home.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span> [<i>shuddering</i>]. You must not say
that!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>.... Except to my sister and the doctor.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. When will the doctor come?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. He will not be able to come before midnight.
[<i>He shuts the door. A clock is heard striking eleven.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. She has come in?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. Who?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. The servant.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. No, she has gone downstairs.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. I thought that she was sitting at the
table.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. The servant?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. Yes.</p>

other?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. You could not live in error long.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span> [<i>trying to rise</i>]. I should like to pierce
this darkness!...</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. Where do you want to go?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. Over there....</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. Don't be so anxious....</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. You are strange this evening.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. It is all of you who seem to me to
be strange!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. Do you want anything?...</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. I do not know what ails me.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Eldest Daughter</span>. Grandfather! grandfather! What
do you want, grandfather?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. Give me your little hands, my children.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Three Daughters</span>. Yes, grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. Why are you all three trembling,
girls?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Eldest Daughter</span>. We are scarcely trembling at all,
grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. I fancy you are all three pale.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Eldest Daughter</span>. It is late, grandfather, and we
are tired.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. You must go to bed, and grandfather himself
would do well to take a little rest.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. I could not sleep to-night!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. We will wait for the doctor.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. Prepare me for the truth.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. But there is no truth!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. Then I do not know what there is!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. I tell you there is nothing at all!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. I wish I could see my poor daughter!</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page280" name="page280"></a>(p. 280)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. But you know quite well it is impossible;
she must not be awaked unnecessarily.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. You will see her to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. There is no sound in her room.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. I should be uneasy if I heard any sound.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. It is a very long time since I saw my
daughter!... I took her hands yesterday evening, but I
could not see her!... I do not know what has become of
her!... I do not know how she is.... I do not know
what her face is like now.... She must have changed these
weeks!... I felt the little bones of her cheeks under my
hands.... There is nothing but the darkness between her
and me, and the rest of you!... I cannot go on living like
this ... this is not living.... You sit there, all of you,
looking with open eyes at my dead eyes, and not one of you
has pity on me!... I do not know what ails me.... No
one tells me what ought to be told me.... And everything
is terrifying when one's dreams dwell upon it.... But why
are you not speaking?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. What should we say, since you will not believe
us?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. You are afraid of betraying yourselves!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. Come now, be rational!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. You have been hiding something from
me for a long time!... Something has happened in the
house.... But I am beginning to understand now....
You have been deceiving me too long!&mdash;You fancy that I shall
never know anything?&mdash;There are moments when I am less
blind than you, you know!... Do you think I have not
heard you whispering&mdash;for days and days&mdash;as if you were in
the house of someone who had been hanged&mdash;I dare not say
what I know this evening.... But I shall know the truth!...
I shall wait for you to tell me the truth; but I have
known it for a long time, in spite of you!&mdash;And now, I feel
that you are all paler than the dead!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Three Daughters</span>. Grandfather! grandfather! What
is the matter, grandfather?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. It is not you that I am speaking of,
girls. No, it is not you that I am speaking of.... I know
quite well you would tell me the truth&mdash;if they were not by!
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page281" name="page281"></a>(p. 281)</span> ... And besides, I feel sure that they are deceiving you as
well.... You will see, children&mdash;you will see!... Do
not I hear you all sobbing?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father.</span> Is my wife really so ill?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. It is no good trying to deceive me any
longer; it is too late now, and I know the truth better than
you!...</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. But <i>we</i> are not blind; we are not.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. Would you like to go into your daughter's
room? This misunderstanding must be put an end to.&mdash;Would
you?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span> [<i>becoming suddenly undecided</i>]. No,
no, not now&mdash;not yet.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle.</span> You see, you are not reasonable.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. One never knows how much a man
has been unable to express in his life!... Who made that
noise?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Eldest Daughter</span>. It is the lamp flickering, grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. It seems to me to be very unsteady&mdash;very!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. It is the cold wind troubling it....</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. There is no cold wind, the windows are shut.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. I think it is going out.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. There is no more oil.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. It has gone right out.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. We cannot stay like this in the dark.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. Why not?&mdash;I am quite accustomed to it.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. There is a light in my wife's room.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. We will take it from there presently, when
the doctor has been.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. Well, we can see enough here; there is the
light from outside.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather.</span> Is it light outside?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. Lighter than here.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. For my part, I would as soon talk in the dark.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father.</span> So would I. [<i>Silence.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. It seems to me the clock makes a great
deal of noise....</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Eldest Daughter</span>. That is because we are not talking
any more, grandfather.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page282" name="page282"></a>(p. 282)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. But why are you all silent?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. What do you want us to talk about?&mdash;You
are really very peculiar to-night.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather.</span> Is it very dark in this room?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. There is not much light. [<i>Silence.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. I do not feel well, Ursula; open the

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. Yes, child; open the window a little. I
begin to feel the want of air myself. [<i>The girl opens the
window.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. I really believe we have stayed shut up too
long.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather.</span> Is the window open?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. Yes, grandfather; it is wide open.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. One would not have thought it was
open; there is not a sound outside.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter.</span> No, grandfather; there is not the slightest
sound.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Father</span>. The silence is extraordinary!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. One could hear an angel tread!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Uncle</span>. That is why I do not like the country.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. I wish I could hear some sound.

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Daughter</span>. It will soon be midnight, grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">The Grandfather</span>. Who is that walking round us like

<span class="smaller"><i>A DRAMA IN ONE ACT</i><br>
By<br>
JOSEPHINE PRESTON PEABODY</span></h1>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page287" name="page287"></a>(p. 287)</span> Josephine Preston Peabody (Mrs. Lionel S. Marks) was
born in New York on May 30, 1874. She attended the Girls'
Latin School in Boston and later went to Radcliffe College.
From 1901 to 1903 she taught English literature at Wellesley
College. Her verse, dramatic and lyric, has made her an outstanding
figure in American letters.</p>

<p><i>Fortune and Men's Eyes</i> (1900), the first of her published
plays, is written in blank verse. <i>Marlowe</i>, likewise a study of
a great Elizabethan, <i>The Wings</i>, the setting of which is early
English, <i>The Piper</i>, a new version of the medieval legend
made famous by Browning, and <i>The Wolf of Gubbio</i>, dominated
by the lovely figure of St. Francis of Assisi, are also
poetic dramas. Her best known play, <i>The Piper</i>, was awarded
the first prize in 1910 in the Stratford-on-Avon competition in
which there were three hundred and fifteen contestants. It
was then produced at the Memorial Theatre at Stratford.</p>

<p>In recent years two playwrights have consulted Shakespeare's
sonnets for dramatic themes; first, Josephine Preston Peabody
found in them a motive for her poetic play, <i>Fortune and Men's
Eyes</i>, and later George Bernard Shaw turned them to dramatic
account, in his own fashion, in <i>The Dark Lady of the Sonnets</i>.
The dramatic situation chosen for <i>Fortune and Men's Eyes</i> has
been read by some Shakespearian scholars into the familiar dedication
of the 1609 edition of the Sonnets, which runs: "To
the only begetter of these ensuing sonnets Mr. W. H. all happiness
and that eternity promised by our ever-living poet
wisheth the well-wishing adventurer in setting forth T. T."
The last initials stand for the name of the publisher, Thomas
Thorpe. "Begetter" has been variously interpreted as inspirer
of the Sonnets or as partner in the commercial enterprise
of their publication. "Mr. W. H." has been more usually
identified with William Herbert, earl of Pembroke, though
some have thought that the initials were inverted and referred
to Henry Wriothesly, earl of Southampton, to whom Shakespeare's
other poems were dedicated. If W. H. does refer to
the earl of Pembroke, it is usually held that the "dark lady"
is in reality the blond Mistress Mary Fytton, whose name
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page288" name="page288"></a>(p. 288)</span> was coupled with Pembroke's. Whether the sonnets are in
any sense at all autobiographical has also been endlessly debated.
It was admittedly an age when every poet tried his
hand at sonnet sequences and in all these sequences, not excepting
Shakespeare's, there are to be found the same conventional
conceits. But it is generally believed now that the
sonnets of Spenser and Sidney refer to the personal experiences
of their authors. It is quite possible, then, that Shakespeare, too,
may have used a literary convention as a means of personal
expression, though it seems impertinent in any case to question
the feeling back of "When in disgrace with fortune and men's
eyes." This brief reference to conflicting interpretations of the
Sonnets shows how material of dramatic value may lurk even
in the purlieus of textual criticism.</p>

<p>Josephine Preston Peabody herself says: "The play was
written after long worship of the W. S. Sonnets, as a method
of introspection, to satisfy my own curiosity concerning the
truth of the sonnet theories. In spite of recurrent threats, by
one actor after another, it has never yet been produced on the
professional stage. But it has been read and recommended for
reading, in various colleges, as a picture of Elizabethan times,
and as an interpretation of the Pembroke-Fytton aspect of the
sonnet story."</p>

<span class="smaller">By<br>
JOHN GALSWORTHY</span></h1>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page323" name="page323"></a>(p. 323)</span> "Close by the Greek temples at Paestum there are violets
that seem redder, and sweeter, than any ever seen&mdash;as though
they have sprung up out of the footprints of some old pagan
goddess; but under the April sun, in a Devonshire lane, the
little blue scentless violets capture every bit as much of the
spring." Affection for the West country that was the home
of John Galsworthy's ancestors heightens the glamour of this
enchanting bit of writing from one of his essays. As he himself
has said, the Galsworthys have been in Devonshire as far
back as records go&mdash;"since the flood of Saxons at all events."
He was born, though, at Coombe in Surrey in 1867. From
1881 to 1886, he was at Harrow where he did well at work
and games. He was graduated with an honor degree in law
from New College, Oxford, in 1889. Following his father's
example, he took up the law and was called to the bar
(Lincoln's Inn) in 1890. "I read," he says, "in various
chambers, practised almost not at all, and disliked my profession
thoroughly."</p>

<p>For nearly two years thereafter, Galsworthy traveled, visiting
among other places, Russia, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand, the Fiji Islands, and South Africa. On a sailing-ship
plying between Adelaide and the Cape he met and made a
friend of the novelist, Joseph Conrad, then still a sailor. Galsworthy
was soon to become a writer himself, publishing his first
novel in 1899. Since that date he has written novels, plays,
essays, and verse that have made him famous.<a id="footnotetag55" name="footnotetag55"></a><a href="#footnote55" title="Go to footnote 55"><span class="smaller">[55]</span></a> Through his
writings he has become a great social force. In this respect his
influence resembles that of Charles Dickens. He has made
people who read his books or see his plays acted think about
the justice or injustice of institutions commonly accepted without
a question. The presentation of his play <i>Justice</i> (1909),
moved the Home Secretary of the day, Winston Churchill, to
put into effect several important reforms affecting the English
prison system.</p>

produced in New York at Maxine Elliott's Theatre in February,
1917, as a curtain raiser to G. K. Chesterton's play,

O. P. Heggie, one of the most intelligent and distinguished
actors on the English-speaking stage. J. Ranken Towse, reviewing
the performance for the Saturday Magazine of the
<i>New York Evening Post</i>, on February 17, 1917, wrote:
"Another entertainment of notable excellence is that provided
by the double bill at Maxine Elliott's Theatre, consisting of
Galsworthy's <i>The Little Man</i> and Chesterton's <i>Magic</i>. Here
are two plays of diverse character and superior quality, in
which some highly intelligent and artistic acting is done by
Mr. O. P. Heggie. Some sensitive reviewers have found cause
of offense in Mr. Galsworthy's somewhat fanciful American,
but the dramatist has been equally disrespectful in his handling
of Germans, Dutch, and English. The value and significance
of the piece, of course, are to be looked for, not in its broad
humors&mdash;which are largely conventional&mdash;but in the ethical
and moral lesson and profound social philosophy which they
suggest and illustrate." It is hard to sympathize with the "sensitive
reviewers," though to the native ear, to be sure, the utterances
of the American lack verisimilitude. The author of <i>The
Little Man</i> has even been humorously reproached with using
the speech of Deadwood Dick for his model.</p>

<p>The play was also given quite recently, during the season of
1920-21, as part of the repertory at the Everyman Theatre in
London. On the programs invariably appears the note which
is prefixed also to this as to every printed version. It explains
carefully that this play was written before the days of the
Great War. This note bespeaks the playwright's perfect detachment
which is, as has been said, "an artistic device, not a
matter of divine indifference." Yet the satire does seem to be
directed, incidentally at least, against certain familiar national
characteristics, for it is the humanity of the Little Man, whose
mixed ancestry is described by the American as being "a bit
streaky," that puts to shame the various types of human arrogance
and indifference with which he is surrounded.</p>

Grand man&mdash;grand-souled apparatus. But I guess you've got
to pinch those waiters some to make 'em skip. [<i>To the</i>
<span class="smcap">English</span>, <i>who have carelessly looked his way for a moment.</i>]
You'll appreciate that, the way he acted about my eggs. [<i>The</i>
<span class="smcap">English</span> <i>make faint motions with their chins, and avert their

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Waiter</span>. Komm' gleich!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span> [<i>affably&mdash;to the</i> <span class="smcap">Little Man</span>]. Now, if I
don't get that flash of beer quicker'n you got yours, I shall
admire.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">German</span> [<i>abruptly</i>]. Tolstoi is nothing&mdash;nichts! No
good! Ha?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span> [<i>relishing the approach of argument</i>]. Well,
that is a matter of temperament. Now, I'm all for equality.
See that poor woman there&mdash;vurry humble woman&mdash;there she
sits among us with her baby. Perhaps you'd like to locate her
somewhere else?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">German</span> [<i>shrugging</i>]. Tolstoi is sentimentalisch. Nietzsche
is the true philosopher, the only one.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. Well, that's quite in the prospectus&mdash;vurry
stimulating party&mdash;old Nietzsch&mdash;virgin mind. But give me
Leo! [<i>He turns to the red-cheeked youth.</i>] What do you
opine, sir? I guess by your labels, you'll be Dutch. Do they
read Tolstoi in your country? [<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Dutch Youth</span> <i>laughs.</i>]</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page328" name="page328"></a>(p. 328)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. That is a vurry luminous answer.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">German</span>. Tolstoi is nothing. Man should himself express.
He must push&mdash;he must be strong.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. That is so. In Amurrica we believe in virility;
we like a man to expand&mdash;to cultivate his soul. But we believe
in brotherhood too; we're vurry democratic. We draw the line
at niggers; but we aspire, we're vurry high-souled. Social barriers
and distinctions we've not much use for.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Englishman</span>. Do you feel a draught?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Englishwoman</span> [<i>with a shiver of her shoulder toward the</i>
<span class="smcap">American</span>]. I do&mdash;rather.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">German</span>. Wait! You are a young people.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. That is so; there are no flies on us. [<i>To the</i>
<span class="smcap">Little Man</span>, <i>who has been gazing eagerly from face to face.</i>]
Say! I'd like to have you give us your sentiments in relation
to the duty of man. [<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Little Man</span> <i>fidgets, and is about
to open his mouth.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. For example&mdash;is it your opinion that we should
kill off the weak and diseased, and all that can't jump around?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">German</span> [<i>nodding</i>]. Ja, ja! That is coming.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Little Man</span> [<i>looking from face to face</i>]. They might be
me. [<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Dutch Youth</span> <i>laughs.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span> [<i>reproving him with a look</i>]. That's true humility.
'Tisn't grammar. Now, here's a proposition that
brings it nearer the bone: Would you step out of your way to
help them when it was liable to bring you trouble?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">German</span>. Nein, nein! That is stupid.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Little Man</span> [<i>eager but wistful</i>]. I'm afraid not. Of
course one wants to&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">German</span>. Nein, nein! That is stupid! What is the duty?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Little Man</span>. There was St. Francis d'Assisi and St. Julien
l'Hospitalier, and&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. Vurry lofty dispositions. Guess they died of
them. [<i>He rises.</i>] Shake hands, sir&mdash;my name is&mdash;[<i>He

<p><span class="min1em speaker">German</span>. Cigarren!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Waiter</span>. Komm' gleich! [<i>He vanishes.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Englishman</span> [<i>consulting watch</i>]. Train's late.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page329" name="page329"></a>(p. 329)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Englishwoman</span>. Really! Nuisance! [<i>A station</i> <span class="smcap">Policeman</span>,

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span> [<i>resuming his seat&mdash;to the</i> <span class="smcap">German</span>]. Now,
we don't have so much of that in Amurrica. Guess we feel
more to trust in human nature.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">German</span>. Ah! ha! you will bresently find there is nothing
in him but self.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Little Man</span> [<i>wistfully</i>]. Don't you believe in human
nature?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. Vurry stimulating question. That invites remark.
[<i>He looks round for opinions. The</i> <span class="smcap">Dutch Youth</span>
<i>laughs.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Englishman</span> [<i>holding out his half of the paper to his wife</i>].
Swap! [<i>His wife swaps.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">German</span>. In human nature I believe so far as I can see
him&mdash;no more.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. Now that 'pears to me kind o' blasphemy. I'm
vurry idealistic; I believe in heroism. I opine there's not one
of us settin' around here that's not a hero&mdash;give him the occasion.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Little Man</span>. Oh! Do you believe that?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. Well! I judge a hero is just a person that'll
help another at the expense of himself. That's a vurry simple
definition. Take that poor woman there. Well, now, she's
a heroine, I guess. She would die for her baby any old time.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">German</span>. Animals will die for their babies. That is
nothing.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. Vurry true. I carry it further. I postulate we
would all die for that baby if a locomotive was to trundle up
right here and try to handle it. I'm an idealist. [<i>To the</i>
<span class="smcap">German</span>.] I guess <i>you</i> don't know how good you are. [<i>As
the</i> <span class="smcap">German</span> <i>is twisting up the ends of his mustache&mdash;to the</i>
<span class="smcap">Englishwoman</span>.] I should like to have you express an
opinion, ma'am. This is a high subject.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Englishwoman</span>. I beg your pardon.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. The English are vurry humanitarian; they have
a vurry high sense of duty. So have the Germans, so have the
Amurricans. [<i>To the</i> <span class="smcap">Dutch Youth</span>.] I judge even in your
little country they have that. This is a vurry civilized epoch.
It is an epoch of equality and high-toned ideals. [<i>To the</i>
<span class="smcap">Little Man</span>.] What is your nationality, sir?</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page330" name="page330"></a>(p. 330)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Little Man</span>. I'm afraid I'm nothing particular. My
father was half-English and half-American, and my mother
half-German and half-Dutch.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. My! That's a bit streaky, any old way. [<i>The</i>
<span class="smcap">Policeman</span> <i>passes again.</i>] Now, I don't believe we've much
use any more for those gentlemen in buttons, not amongst the
civilized peoples. We've grown kind of mild&mdash;we don't think
of self as we used to do. [<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Waiter</span> <i>has appeared in the

<p><span class="min1em speaker">German</span> [<i>in a voice of thunder</i>]. Cigarren! Donnerwetter!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Waiter</span>. Komm' gleich!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. A little more, and he will join George Washington!
I was about to remark when he intruded: The kingdom
of Christ nowadays is quite a going concern. The Press
is vurry enlightened. We are mighty near to universal brotherhood.
The colonel here [<i>he indicates the</i> <span class="smcap">German</span>], he
doesn't know what a lot of stock he holds in that proposition.
He is a man of blood and iron, but give him an opportunity
to be magnanimous, and he'll be right there. Oh, sir! yes.
[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">German</span>, <i>with a profound mixture of pleasure and
cynicism, brushes up the ends of his mustache.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Little Man</span>. I wonder. One wants to, but somehow&mdash;[<i>He
shakes his head.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. You seem kind of skeery about that. You've
had experience maybe. The flesh is weak. I'm an optimist&mdash;I
think we're bound to make the devil hum in the near future.
I opine we shall occasion a good deal of trouble to that old
party. There's about to be a holocaust of selfish interests.
We're out for high sacrificial business. The colonel there with
old-man Nietzsch&mdash;he won't know himself. There's going to
be a vurry sacred opportunity. [<i>As he speaks, the voice of a</i>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. Now, that's vurry provoking. I won't get that

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. So you say. But I judge your form of chivalry
is sacrifice to the state. We allow more freedom to the individual
soul. Where there's something little and weak, we feel

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. Where's the mother?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Little Man</span> [<i>ruefully</i>]. Afraid she got left behind. [<i>The</i>
<span class="smcap">Dutch Youth</span> <i>laughs. The</i> <span class="smcap">English</span> <i>unconsciously emerge
from their newspapers.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. My! That would appear to be quite a domestic
incident. [<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Englishman</span> <i>suddenly utters a profound
"Ha, Ha!" and disappears behind his paper. And that paper
and the one opposite are seen to shake, and little squirls and
squeaks emerge.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">German</span>. And you haf got her bundle, and her baby. Ha!
[<i>He cackles dryly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span> [<i>gravely</i>]. I smile. I guess Providence has
played it pretty low down on you. I judge it's acted real mean.
[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Baby</span> <i>wails, and the</i> <span class="smcap">Little Man</span> <i>jigs it with a sort of

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. Maybe you'd better get off right smart and restore
that baby. There's nothing can act madder than a
mother.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Little Man</span>. Poor thing; yes! What she must be suffering!
[<i>A gale of laughter shakes the carriage. The</i> <span class="smcap">English</span>

<span class="smcap">Little Man</span> <i>smiles a wintry smile.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span> [<i>in a lull</i>]. How did it eventuate?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Little Man</span>. We got there just as the train was going to
start; and I jumped, thinking I could help her up. But it
moved too quickly, and&mdash;and&mdash;left her. [<i>The gale of laughter
blows up again.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. Guess I'd have thrown the baby out.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Little Man</span>. I was afraid the poor little thing might
break. [<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Baby</span> <i>wails; the</i> <span class="smcap">Little Man</span> <i>heaves it; the gale
of laughter blows.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span> [<i>gravely</i>]. It's highly entertaining&mdash;not for the
baby. What kind of an old baby is it, anyway? [<i>He sniffs.</i>]
I judge it's a bit&mdash;niffy.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Little Man</span>. Afraid I've hardly looked at it yet.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. Which end up is it?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Little Man</span>. Oh! I think the right end. Yes, yes, it is.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. Well, that's something. Guess I should hold it
out of winder a bit. Vurry excitable things, babies!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Englishwoman</span> [<i>galvanized</i>]. No, no!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Englishman</span> [<i>touching her knee</i>]. My dear!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. You are right, ma'am. I opine there's a draught
out there. This baby is precious. We've all of us got stock
in this baby in a manner of speaking. This is a little bit of
universal brotherhood. Is it a woman baby?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Little Man</span>. I&mdash;I can only see the top of its head.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. You can't always tell from that. It looks
kind of over-wrapped-up. Maybe it had better be unbound.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">German</span>. Nein, nein, nein!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. I think you are vurry likely right, colonel. It
might be a pity to unbind that baby. I guess the lady should
be consulted in this matter.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Englishwoman</span>. Yes, yes, of course&mdash;I&mdash;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page334" name="page334"></a>(p. 334)</span>
<p><span class="min1em speaker">Englishman</span> [<i>touching her</i>]. Let it be! Little beggar
seems all right.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. That would seem only known to Providence at
this moment. I judge it might be due to humanity to look at
its face.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Little Man</span> [<i>gladly</i>]. It's sucking my finger. There,
there&mdash;nice little thing&mdash;there!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. I would surmise you have created babies in your
leisure moments, sir?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Little Man</span>. Oh! no&mdash;indeed, no.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. Dear me! That is a loss. [<i>Addressing himself
to the carriage at large.</i>] I think we may esteem ourselves fortunate
to have this little stranger right here with us; throws
a vurry tender and beautiful light on human nature. Demonstrates
what a hold the little and weak have upon us nowadays.
The colonel here&mdash;a man of blood and iron&mdash;there he
sits quite ca'm next door to it. [<i>He sniffs.</i>] Now, this baby
is ruther chastening&mdash;that is a sign of grace, in the colonel&mdash;that
is true heroism.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Little Man</span> [<i>faintly</i>]. I&mdash;I can see its face a little now.
[<i>All bend forward.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. What sort of a physiognomy has it, anyway?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Little Man</span> [<i>still faintly</i>]. I don't see anything but&mdash;but
spots.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">German</span>. Oh! Ha! Pfui! [<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Dutch Youth</span>
<i>laughs.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. I am told that is not uncommon amongst
babies. Perhaps we could have you inform us, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Englishwoman</span>. Yes, of course&mdash;only&mdash;what sort of&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Little Man</span>. They seem all over its&mdash;[<i>At the slight
recoil of everyone.</i>] I feel sure it's&mdash;it's quite a good baby
underneath.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. That will be ruther difficult to come at. I'm
just a bit sensitive. I've vurry little use for affections of the
epidermis.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">German</span>. Pfui! [<i>He has edged away as far as he can get,
and is lighting a big cigar. The</i> <span class="smcap">Dutch Youth</span> <i>draws his
legs back.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span> [<i>also taking out a cigar</i>]. I guess it would be
well to fumigate this carriage. Does it suffer, do you think?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Little Man</span> [<i>peering</i>]. Really, I don't&mdash;I'm not sure&mdash;I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page335" name="page335"></a>(p. 335)</span> know so little about babies. I think it would have a nice
expression&mdash;if&mdash;if it showed.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. Is it kind of boiled-looking?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Little Man</span>. Yes&mdash;yes, it is.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span> [<i>looking gravely round</i>]. I judge this baby has
the measles. [<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">German</span> <i>screws himself spasmodically
against the arm of the</i> <span class="smcap">Englishwoman's</span> <i>seat.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Englishwoman</span>. Poor little thing! Shall I&mdash;? [<i>She
half-rises.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Englishman</span> [<i>touching her</i>]. No, no&mdash;Dash it!</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. I honor your emotion, ma'am. It does credit
to us all. But I sympathize with your husband too. The
measles is a vurry important pestilence in connection with a
grown woman.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Little Man</span>. It likes my finger awfully. Really, it's
rather a sweet baby.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span> [<i>sniffing</i>]. Well, that would appear to be quite
a question. About them spots, now? Are they rosy?</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Little Man</span>. No&mdash;o; they're dark, almost black.</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">German</span>. Gott! Typhus! [<i>He bounds up onto the arm
of the</i> <span class="smcap">Englishwoman's</span> <i>seat.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span>. Typhus! That's quite an indisposition! [<i>The</i>
<span class="smcap">Dutch Youth</span> <i>rises suddenly, and bolts out into the corridor.

<span class="smcap">English</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">American</span> <i>sit a moment longer without speaking.
The</i> <span class="smcap">Englishwoman's</span> <i>face is turned with a curious expression&mdash;half-pity,
half-fear&mdash;toward the</i> <span class="smcap">Little Man</span>. <i>Then
the</i> <span class="smcap">Englishman</span> <i>gets up.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">Englishman</span>. Bit stuffy for you here, dear, isn't it? [<i>He
puts his arm through hers, raises her, and almost pushes her
through the doorway. She goes, still looking back.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span> [<i>gravely</i>]. There's nothing I admire more'n
courage. Guess I'll go and smoke in the corridor. [<i>As he goes
out the</i> <span class="smcap">Little Man</span> <i>looks very wistfully after him. Screwing
up his mouth and nose, he holds the</i> <span class="smcap">Baby</span> <i>away from him
and wavers; then rising, he puts it on the seat opposite and goes
through the motions of letting down the window. Having done
so he looks at the</i> <span class="smcap">Baby</span>, <i>who has begun to wail. Suddenly he
raises his hands and clasps them, like a child praying. Since,
however, the</i> <span class="smcap">Baby</span> <i>does not stop wailing, he hovers over it in
indecision; then, picking it up, sits down again to dandle it,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page336" name="page336"></a>(p. 336)</span> with his face turned toward the open window. Finding that
it still wails, he begins to sing to it in a cracked little voice. It
is charmed at once. While he is singing, the</i> <span class="smcap">American</span> <i>appears
in the corridor. Letting down the passage window, he
stands there in the doorway with the draught blowing his hair
and the smoke of his cigar all about him. The</i> <span class="smcap">Little Man</span>
<i>stops singing and shifts the shawl higher, to protect the</i> <span class="smcap">Baby's</span>
<i>head from the draught.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="min1em speaker">American</span> [<i>gravely</i>]. This is the most sublime spectacle I
have ever envisaged. There ought to be a record of this. [<i>The</i>
<span class="smcap">Little Man</span> <i>looks at him, wondering.</i>] We have here a most
stimulating epitome of our marvelous advance toward universal
brotherhood. You are typical, sir, of the sentiments of modern
Christianity. You illustrate the deepest feelings in the heart
of every man. [<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Little Man</span> <i>rises with the</i> <span class="smcap">Baby</span> <i>and a
movement of approach.</i>] Guess I'm wanted in the dining-car.
[<i>He vanishes.</i>] [The <span class="smcap">Little Man</span> <i>sits down again, but back
to the engine, away from the draught, and looks out of the window,
patiently jogging the</i> <span class="smcap">Baby</span> <i>on his knee.</i>]</p>

shall all go home and treasure the memory of his face as the
whitest thing in our museum of recollections. And perhaps
this good woman will also go home and wash the face of our
little brother here. I am inspired with a new faith in mankind.

of the long "apron," projecting in front of the proscenium. The
characters were constantly stepping out of the frame of the picture;
and while this visual convention maintained itself, there was nothing
inconsistent or jarring in the auditory convention of the soliloquy.

For instance, the New York Drama League announces a Little Theatre
membership. "Its purpose is to serve the needs of the large and constantly
growing public that is interested in the activities of the semi-professional
and amateur community groups who read or produce
plays. Under this new Membership there will be issued monthly, for
ten issues a Play List of five pages, giving a concise but complete
synopsis of new plays, both one-act and longer plays. It will show
the number of characters required; the kind of audience to which the
play would be likely to appeal; the royalty asked for production
rights; the production necessities and other information of value to
production groups or individuals. One page will be devoted to three
or four standard older plays treated with the same detail of information.
The Little Theatre Supplement ... will continue to be
issued each month, but will hereafter be a feature of the Little Theatre
Membership only. It will contain the programs of the Little Theatres
throughout the country; short accounts of what is going on among the
various groups, and articles on Little Theatre problems, with hints on
new, effective and economical methods of production."</p>

<p>Since it is just possible that someone may think <i>The Little Man</i>
has a deep, dark reference to the war, it may be as well to state that
this whimsey was written in October, 1913.</p>
